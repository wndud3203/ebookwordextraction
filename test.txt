Prologue
Part 1
--[Urban Legends].
That was also one of the [Desires] of which the amount almost numbered
the expanse of stars in the sky.
--For example, the Urban Legend that 'No Human has really ever stepped
a foot on the moon'.
--For example, the conspiracy of the Freemasons in the American dollar
bills.
--For example, the time-space experiment that took place in Philadelphia.
The Chiyoda Line's nuclear shelter, Area 51, the Roswell UFO incident,
etc.
After seeing this many examples, it can be concluded that there is always
some kind of distinct pattern between them. That pattern is a...'It would be
interesting if it was real' kind of [Desire].
Smoke will not rise without fire as its source. However, as it spreads and
builds up, that [Desire] becomes a [Rumor].
This kind of thinking was not strange to the world. Since ancient times,
Humans have always preferred the [Inevitable] to an [Accident], after all.
The birth of mankind was likely the accidental product of astronomical
probability. According to the humans, there was something that
intentionally wanted to create humans.
Looking from this way of thinking, the world was not chaotic, but more
orderly. By imagining out a reason behind the meaning of existence, to
help explore the vagaries and ruthless values of this world.
..........People lived with this desire in their hearts. Therefore, [Urban
Legends] can also be said to be something that was born from earnest
[Desire].
—Then. In this planet where there were enough [Urban Legends] to
illuminate the skies, there were examples of [It being obviously the truth,

yet still being treated as an urban legend]. In the end, nobody knows if they
were real.
—Don't be mistaken, this does not mean that the aforementioned urban
legends are true.
Only, the reason behind the existence of these urban legends are
somewhat different from rumors.
Now then, how did this [Urban Legend] come about? It started as any
ordinary [Rumor]. But it became a rumor that was so unrealistic that it
changed from a [Rumor] to an [Urban Legend]. And that kind of [Rumor] is
like this one.
There was a rumor that had spread in the internet about a gamer named
『 』[1]. According to more than 280 Online Game Rankings, there was
a player with an undefeated record that always stood proudly at top of the
rankings with 『 』 as his name. "There is no way something like that
could exist" may be what you are thinking. That was also what everyone
else believed and it became a simple hypothesis.
'That was just the doing of the development staff to make the game
become popular using a player with the name 『 』. In reality, that kind
of player does not exist at all.'
The game developers who did not expose the identity of 『 』 caused an
unknowingly explosive action to happen, like a form of beauty, with this
player who did not exist—
But, the strange thing was that he participated in wars and many players
have faced against him.
He was unrivaled...just like a raging storm.
He was said...to have beaten a Grandmaster level chess program
completely.
He was said...to have an aberrant playing style and having a hand that
was hard to read.
He was said...to have been using Tool Assists, and to have relied on
Cheat Codes.
He was said.....was said.....was said.....

One who was interested in that 'Rumor' decided to investigate it
furthermore.
The method was not that hard. If a person was placed first in either a
Consumer Game, PC Game, or Social Game, that person would surely
have an account. And if the account exists, the list of achievements can
also be investigated.
But the one that investigated it furthermore actually fell into a trap.
Because 『 』 in reality had his own account for every game console
and SNS, and same with the number of games, it was [Countless]. He
didn't have even one black spot in his win-loss records.
--With that, the mystery thickened and some even hypothesized that
『 』 was a hacker that erased his own loss records, a group of gamers
that only high-level players were invited to, etc.
With this, a new [Urban Legend] was born.
—However, in this case, the person who created this 『
be responsible.

』 rumor must

Because he had an account, he was given the right to speak, but he
completely ignored this privilege.
Silent, not even communicating at all.
Since there was no provision of information, everything was a mystery
besides the fact that 『 』 was Japanese.
No one has seen his real face— This has also been the main reason why
the urban legend was accelerating.
—So.
—Let us introduce.
—The truth.
Crowned in the world ranking for his victorious battles in over 280 games.
This record has never been broken since the establishment of his identity,
the legendary player.
『

』—his true identity——!

Part 2
"...Aa.....I'm dying....aa, now I died for real.......hey, my little sister, hurry up,
rez[2], rez~!"
"*Zuzu*......It is impossible....to use feet for controlling a mouse...."
"Whatever, hurry up, my little sister--Or should I say, my sly little
sister--even though I have not even eaten for three days, you are eating
instant noodles? On top of that, you're doing so while in battle."

"Nii, you want to eat too...? Something like Calorie Mate[3] or so...."
"Ah, that thing that only those bourgeois eat[4]. Like hell I'll eat something
like that. That aside, please hurry up, reserve!"
"...*Zuzuzu*.......here, Nii's share."
"Oh! Thank you~.....by the way, what time is it now?"
"Let see.......still eight o' clock at night."
"What a novel way to describe eight o' clock in the morning as 'night'.
Then, what day is today?"
"....Who knows? Wait....one, two.....four cup of instant noodles
so.......fourth day?"
"Wait, my little sister. I don't mean how much time has passed since we
started pulling all-nighters gaming. What I mean is the 'date' of today."
"Does that even matter.....to Nii who is a NEET?"
"Of course it matters--something like an online event or tournament could
have happened!"
--Like that, was a conversation of a certain boy and girl while playing net
games.
Their glances met with each other's inside the room as they chatted.
The size of the room was around sixteen tatami mats[5]. Considerably
wide. However, inside it was full of game consoles, four consoles for each
person--so a total of eight of them.
On the floor there were many game packages that were already unsealed,
and also [Food]- which were instant noodle packages and mineral water
bottles scattered on the floor, which made the sense of 'wide' unable to be
felt at all.
The LED display gave off a faint light and the only source of light other
than that was the sunlight that was even now blocked by curtains.
"...Nii, are you.......not going to find a job?"
"--Then why didn't you also go to school, my little sister?"
"..."

"..."
Just like that they ended their conversation and no one spoke on the
subject thereafter.
The older brother--Sora. Eighteen years old. No occupation. A cherry
boy[6]. Unpopular. Unable to communicate well. Game freak. Wearing a
T-shirt and jeans that gave the impression of being a shut-in with unkempt
black hair.
The little sister--Shiro. Ten years old. Truant. Didn't have any friends. A
bullied child. Anthropophobia.[7] Game freak. One would doubt whether
she had a blood relation or not with her brother because she had white hair
in contrast to her brother's. Her hair was so long that it flowed down over
her face and she wore the school sailor uniform that she never even worn
since she transferred schools.
That was the true identity of 『 』 (Kuuhaku) (空白) which was the
combination of their names, Sora (空) and Shiro (白).
—This is the truth.
If everybody knew this, nobody would want to pursue or accept this truth,
and would continue to keep hugging the illusions of the urban legend.

Part 3
Now, it seems that the process of forming an [Urban Legend] has already
been explained.
In short, that was Humanity's [Desire], born from the disorder of this world.
It was not 'inevitable', but it was closer to an 'accident'.
The world is unreasonable and irrational.
It has no meaning at all.
The desire of one who recognized and yet didn't accept the truth of this
can make the boring world more interesting. Born from earnest [Desire],
namely—an [Urban Legend].
Then, how about I lend a hand to make the world become a bit more
interesting, by making a new [Urban Legend]?

--For now, let's write with stylistic beauty like this.
--The story begins with this opening.
--[Have you ever heard about this rumor?]
One day, an e-mail came to a 'person' that said was to be this world's best
gamer.
It was only a short, mysterious message with an additional URL inside it.
When one has clicked it, a certain game will be started.
Once that person has cleared that game, they will......

Part 4
"....Argh, enough already with this.......gonna sleep."
"Wait! You are the one that's in charge of the team's recovery, and if you
log out--"
".....If it's you, Nii, you will be able to do it."
"Theoretically it is possible! If I operate my own two characters with both
my hands and also two of yours using both my feet after all--"
".....Fi...ght!"
"Wait! Please wait a moment, my little sister! If you sleep I will surely
die----Uoooooooo, you see, I've gone and died!"
The stack of instant noodle cups had already become a tower five cups
tall. Which also means that these siblings have already done all-nighters
gaming for five days straight.
Even knowing that her brother was in a bitter situation, Shiro still slept
anyway, using a game console as her pillow.
Ring-Suddenly a tone notifying the siblings that they had mail sounded.
"....Nii, an e-mail."

"Just what are you demanding from your brother who's currently playing
using four characters on four different screens? You still want a request
from me, but I really have no more extra strength!"
He skillfully operated the mouse using both his hands and his feet. He
furiously commanded a party of four by himself and answered in one
breath.
"I'm sure it's just another advertisement e-mail anyway, just ignore it--"
"....What if....it came from a friend?"
"Whose friend?"
"...Nii's."
"Haha, how weird, somehow I can feel you stabbing me through my chest
with such ironic statement, my lovely sister."
"I don't...want you to say...it's mine.........."
"Then it's an advertisement e-mail after all. Or should I say, if you want to
sleep, just sleep! If you're not going to sleep, please help me a bit
here--Noooo, died, I've died!"
Let's repeat it again. Eighteen years old. Without an occupation. A cherry
boy. Unpopular. Unable to communicate well. Game freak. It's not boasting
but, it wasn't just that he didn't have a girlfriend, he didn't have even one
person that could be called a [Friend]. That was also the same with the
little sister.
"...Uu....what a bother."
Shiro tried to wake up her consciousness and muster all her strength to get
up. It would be no problem if that really was an advertisement. But, one
that couldn't be ignored is an advertisement about a new game.
"....Nii, where is the tablet PC...?"
"At three o'clock from there, in the second mountain of eroge from the left,
and placed around the third and forth box--Uooooo, my feet are getting
cramped!"
Ignoring the brother who was in anguish, Shiro easily found it in the exact
location that Sora specified. Perhaps one would question why a hikikomori
and a NEET would need a tablet PC. But that is of course a foolish

question, because the answer is obviously that it is used for gaming. But,
that was not the main use of the tablet PC. For countless games they also
need countless e-mail addresses, but even excluding the addresses that
were not for gaming use, there were still more than 30 e-mail accounts
which were all synchronized. This is what true efficiency is.
"....The sound is Ring-- so it came from..... the third address of the main
account......is it this one?"
The white-haired girl whose memory was extraordinary compared to a
ordinary person, easily found the message.
And then—the person at the back who lead a successful crusade against
people in real-time combat by manipulating four roles at once, let out a roar
of triumph, before she viewed the e-mail.
【New mail----Subject: To the both of you, 『

』.】

"...?"
Shiro bent her head slightly.
E-mails that were addressed to 『

』 were not rare.

War Requests, Invitations, Provocative Challenges--those are what they
commonly receive, but-"...Nii."
"What is it, my cruel little sister who said that she wanted to sleep and
abandon your brother alone in the game, and in the end didn't sleep and
still left your physically tired brother to play?""
"....This."
As if she didn't hear the sarcasm from her brother who didn't look like he
was about to listen, Shiro showed the mail to her brother.
"Hmm---what is this?"
The brother noticed that the mail looked peculiar.
"Saving. Okay, that's done. Checking the item drops, that's done too."

After checking that there was nothing wrong, Sora closed the game screen
that had been continuously running since five days ago and switched it to
his inbox to check out the e-mail that he had just received.
"...How does guy know that 『

』 is actually siblings?"

There were actually a lot of people that hypothesized that 『 』 was
actually a group of people, but the main problem lies not from the what was
written as the subject, but from the content that said-【Have you siblings ever felt that you guys were born into the wrong
world?】
"What.....is this?"
"............."
It was a somewhat, no, it was a considerably strange message. It also
included a URL that they had never seen before. At the end of the URL,
there was no [.jp] to represent the country domain name. This URL was
pointed to a specific page—and it looked like it was linked to a game.
"...What should we do?"
Shiro who did not seem very interested, went back to her game console
pillow and tried to sleep. Which means that she would just leave the
decision up to her brother-"Hmm, so 'you' plan on making me take a bet on it, huh. Well, even if this
thing turns out to be just a bluff in the end, let's just treat it as another
amusement."
He made that decision and clicked on the URL. He was on full alert in case
of a virus infection, while the security software was running full throttle.
What appeared there on the screen was just simple online chess.
".....*Yawn*...good night..."
"Wait wait wait! This is a challenge for 『 』, you know. If the other party
has an advanced chess program, just me alone will not be enough to win!"
Sora tried to stop his sister from sleeping.
"...Who plays chess well...these days...."
"Umm, I know how you feel but...."

A program that was able to beat even the strongest Grandmasters. Even
with that, the little sister had lost interest in chess after beating this
program twenty consecutive times.
"It wouldn't be forgiven if 『 』 lost. Please at least stay awake until we
know the extent of the opponent's ability."
"....Uuuu.....it can't be helped."
And then Sora started the game. After seeing her brother do one move,
two moves, Shiro began nod off because of the sense of sleepiness that
had piled up. Five moves, ten moves, and before he knew it half of the
board had already been filled with pieces. Shiro suddenly snapped her
eyes open and stared the screen.
"...Huh? This guy is...."
While Sora was feeling uncomfortable, Shiro stood up and said something.
"...Nii, change players..."
Without any objections, Sora obediently stood up from the chair and
moved. Shiro thought that her older brother could do no more at this point.
In other words, Shiro recognized that the other party was a worthy
opponent. The little sister who had just changed places with her brother
started to plan her moves.
Chess is a [Zero-sum game of limited decisions]. In this game where [Luck]
was non-existent and occasionally point game. In theory, a surefire way to
win existed, but in the end that is just theory. It is based on mastering and
being able to see every single possible move- 10^120 of them. A person
who could do that surely did not exist.
But there was someone who could assert that [Existence], and that was
Shiro. She had mastered and could comprehend the large--no, enormous-amount of possible moves in chess. If you keep choosing the best chess
moves, then you will have the upper hand and win if you go first. If you
went second the way of escape was a draw. That is how the theory goes.
What about against an opponent who could foresee two hundred million
moves in a second? This world's strongest chess program was proven to
not be perfect enough for the little sister when she had won 20 consecutive
victories against it.
"....No way."

And that kind of strongest player had just been surprised by what was in
front of her.
"Calm down. This, I'm sure the other party is human."
"Why?"
"In a program's case, it would always choose the best move to play. In one
way that is a good thing, but on the other hand it also means that it can
only use tactics that it was already programed to use. That's why you can
win against them easily. But this guy is--"
Sora pointed at the screen.
"The other party lured you in and made you play a bad move, and if you
feel that it natural for a program to do that, then you would be wrong."
"....Uuu."
The little sister was unable to object to her older brother's words.
--Of course, regarding their abilities playing chess, no, in most games
Shiro and Sora were overwhelming strong. Perhaps calling them by the
title "genius gamers" would not be an exaggeration. In Shiro's case, she
can only act based on her logic. That's why she can easily defeat even the
most powerful advanced chess programs. However, her ability in sensing
other people's [Motives] is dull. That's why at times like this, Shiro needed
to leave it to Sora. Even though he had poor communication skills, his
perception in feeling other peoples' [Motives] was unexpectedly
outstanding.
"Calm down, if the opponent is not a program, all the more reason that
there's no way you will lose. Don't be taken in by his provocation. I will
point out every one of his provocations and tactics so that you beat him."
".....Understood.....Shiro will do her best..."
This is the reason behind their success in becoming the world's best
gamer.
The game had now been running for more than six hours. Adrenaline and
dopamine were flowing from their brains, making them forget their fatigue
from doing all-nighters gaming for five days, and helping them concentrate
to the utmost limit. Six hours--but that felt to them as if the game had
already lasted for several days.

Finally, the last decisive moments happened. And then a emotionless
voice signaling the end of the game could be heard from the speakers.
'Checkmate'
That was the siblings' win.
""...""
After a long silence-""Fuaaaaaaah.""
They each took a long breath. It was almost as if the game had made them
forget to breathe. After taking another long breath, the two started
laughing.
"Amazing......it's been a while.....since I've played in a hard fight like this."
"Haha, that was the first time I ever saw you have a hard time when
dealing with a simple game though, right?"
"...Nii, is the opponent.....really a human?"
"Yes, I'm sure of it. He took a lot of time when deciding to provoke you into
a trap to make you play a bad move, and when it didn't work I could sense
a feeling of disturbance from him. I'm sure he is a human--or maybe a
'monster'."
"...I wonder what kind of person he is."
The little sister that was even able to beat a Grandmaster level chess
program sounded interested.
"Maybe a Grandmaster? Programs are exact, but a human is complex
after all."
"...I see...next time....I want to play....Shogi against that Dragon King."
"Will the Dragon King even accept your shogi challenge? Why don't we
find out!"
After the game, the two of them felt a great sense of happiness and
grinned happily while they were talking.
Ring--

Suddenly, the mail notification tone could be heard.
"Hey, maybe that e-mail just now is from the opponent. Try opening it."
".....Un."
But the content of the e-mail was only one sentence.
【Well done. With that kind of ability, I am sure you find living to be
painful?】
With only that single sentence, it was as if their mental states had dropped
to zero degrees. Silence filled the room, and only the sound of the PC's
fans could be heard. Countless wires were strewn over the floor, along with
scattered trash and clothes. It felt as if time was frozen in that room where
curtains blocked out the sunlight, and a sense of deprivation of space filled
the air. Isolated in the narrow sixteen tatami sized room. This was the
world the siblings were in—all of it.
--Unpleasant memories were running through their minds.
The older brother, who naturally excelled at reading people's true motives
just by hearing their words. The white haired, red eyed little sister, who by
nature had high intelligence--but was a person that no one could
understand. The two siblings had shut their hearts after their parents
passed away. No matter how optimistically they tried to recount memories
of the past— No, even now it was still the same.
The little sister silently bowed.
Not long after thinking that, the older brother angrily started to type a reply.
【None of your business! Who the hell are you anyways?】
A reply came almost right away after he replied to the message. No,
whether it could really be called a reply or not could be doubted because
the content of this new e-mail was-【What do you guys think about this world? Is it interesting? Is it a place
that can make you guys feel at ease?】
Because of these words, the older brother forgot about his anger and
made eye contact with his younger sister.
There was no need to reconfirm, the answer has long been clear from the
start.

"It's a shit game[8]."
...With no clear objectives or rules, a stupid game.
Around seven billion players move as they please.
Ones that have more than others get penalized. The little sister who was
now isolated, was isolated because she was smarter than those of her
age-- no one could understand her and she was bullied.
Even ones that have less than others get penalized. The older brother, The
always smiling brother who always failed, even when scolded by parents or
teachers.
Never had the rights to skip.
--Silence only made one a target to be bullied by others.
--Talking too much made one become alienated by others.
--Being able to read peoples' real intentions too much also made one
become alienated by others.
No clear objectives, no parameters, even the genre is unknown.
Ones that do as the rules say are punished, yet ones that ignore the rules
are not punished and even look down from their positions as the elite. No
game could be compared with this kind of difficult, worst game.
"Damn it!"
Sora grit his teeth and caressed his little sister's head.
The atmosphere of those two who felt like they could stand in the realm of
gods after that exciting game was gone. What was there, was only these
two siblings who were isolated from society. They were only but
depressed, frail humans.
The sound Ring-- could suddenly be heard.
The older brother controlling the cursor did not care and was about to shut
down the computer. But, his sister held his hands to stop him.
【What if a world where everything was decided by a simple game
existed--】

Sora, who had actually tried to turn off the PC just then, was unable to do
anything other than read that after seeing those words.
【--A world where the objectives and rules were clear, a world on top of a
game board, what do you think?】
The two exchanged looks, laughing, and both of them nodded their heads.
Then the older brother began typing on the keyboard.
【If that kind of world actually does exist, then that really does mean that
we were born into the wrong world.】
Is what he replied after he read the content of the letter.
Suddenly--ShaaaaaThe PC's screen gave off a faint noise and then it made a sound
like a circuit breaker overloading. After that sound, nothing else could be
heard and it was as if everything had stopped; only the screen with the
e-mail had been left moving.
"Just what is--"
"...!"
Noise could be heard within the room. There was a sound that sounded
like the house itself was creaking, and there was also the sound of an
electrical discharge. The brother panicked and quickly looked around the
room, and the little sister just stared, dumbfounded. After that, the noise
became increasingly intense and finally became a sound that was not
unlike that of the static noise from an empty TV channel. And then from the
speakers--no, from the screen of the computer, a [Voice] could be heard.
[I also think the same. You two were born into the wrong world.]
Suddenly a pair of white hands appeared from the screen.
"Wha--!"
"...Hiii!"
The hands dragged both of them by the wrists towards the screen.
[I will let you siblings be born again- again, in the world where you two
should have been born!]

Their vision filled with a blinding white light, and they shut their eyes.
When they had opened their eyes again, the first thing that they noticed
was the light and warmth of the sun. It had been a while since they had
last felt it, and also the sensation of the retinas being burned by the light.
The brother who had come to his senses first, after his pupils adjusted,
noticed that they were both high up in the sky.
"Uooooooooooo!"
The scenery had suddenly shifted from a narrow room to a vast expanse of
space.
They were--in the air.
Suddenly appearing in the vast sky, Sora, who finally grasped the situation
shouted.
"What the hell is thiiiiis!"
No matter how he saw it, no matter how many times he looked, he was
sure that the whole island underneath him--and other islands as well-were floating. There was also a certain creature that had flown by him in
the sky, a dragon. In the distance, he could see a number of immensely
large chess pieces near a range of mountains, which could have made
people lose their sense of distance.
'What's with this fantasy-like kind of entrance?' is what was floating through
Sora's mind. The scenery, no matter how many times he tried to compare
it, was not the same scenery from the [Earth] that he knew. But the main
problem right now, he quickly realized, was not that. Currently, they were
both skydiving without single parachute--a free fall.
"I'm going to die!"
It took 3 seconds for him to be convinced of this.
But, as if to break this sorrowful confirmation, a loud shouting could be
heard beside him.
"Welcome to my world!"
The [Boy] falling beside him said while opening his arms and laughing.

"This is the Utopia that you guys dreamed of, the world on top of a game
board, [Disboard]--everything here is decided by a game, even one's life
and country borders!"
Sora probably understood about 10 seconds later.
Shiro, who understood the situation as soon as she opened her eyes,
embraced her brother while crying.
".....Who are you--?"
Shiro tried her best to shout while falling at a frighteningly high speed, but
ended up only murmuring her question. But the boy answered while still
smiling like usual.
"Me? About me~ I....live there."
He said that while pointing in the direction of the giant chess pieces near
the horizon, which Sora had seen for the first time only a short while ago.
"Hmm, in your world you might call me 'God', right?"
Placing his index finger on his cheek, the self-proclaimed god spoke cutely
and full of friendliness.
—However, nobody knew if what he said was true.
"This isn't the time for that! We're falling towards the ground at a really fast
speed--whoaaah! Shiro!"
"...............................!"
Not knowing if it would do any good, Sora held Shiro within his arms and
then he turned his body so that he would be below Shiro. After that, Shiro
who was in Sora's arms issued a soundless scream.
Seeing that, the boy who called himself God spoke to them with a happy
tone.
"I look forward to seeing you again. Yes, without a doubt, it won't be long."
And like that, their consciousnesses blacked out.

Part 5
"U....Uun....."

The feeling of soil. The aromatic smell of grass. When Sora had recovered
his consciousness, he realized that he was on the ground.
"Just what the hell was that...."
Was this a dream? Is what Sora thought but he didn't say it out loud.
"....Uu....what a weird dream."
The little sister who woke up a bit later than Sora moaned.
Hey, little sister. Don't raise the "isn't this a dream" flag. Sora thought about
saying this, but deliberately decided against it.
While having such thoughts, Sora stood up and pretended that nothing had
happened, but what was under his feet was undoubtedly land.
The fresh blue sky, which he had also not seen in a while, was above him.
"Whoaaaaa!"
Sora realized that he was standing on the edge of a cliff, and hurriedly
backed off by two steps.
Then, overlooking the landscape across the cliff.
An incredible landscape was laid out before his eyes.
......No, that expression wasn't right. It was a different word, but what?
There were floating islands and dragons. And across the mountains on the
horizon were huge chess pieces.
This means that it was the view they had of the world while falling.
Which means that--it was not a dream...
"Hey, my little sister."
".....Un...."
Overlooking the picturesque view of the landscape, he said.
"I've always thought that 'life' was an impossible game--a game that was fit
only for masochists."
"......Un....."

And then they said with their voices in harmony.
""So it finally bugged out, huh...enough, what the hell is this super awful
shit game!""
After that— both of them lost consciousness again.

Part 6
--[Have you ever heard about this rumor?]
One day, an e-mail came to a 'person' that said was to be this world's best
gamer.
It was only a short, mysterious message with an additional URL inside it.
When one has clicked it, a certain game will be started.
Once that one has cleared that game, they will disappear from 'this' world.
And then that person will be invited to a parallel universe.
That kind of [Urban Legend] which invited people to another world....will
you believe it?

Chapter 1 - Beginner/Amateur
Part 1

—In a past that was far too long ago.
The Old Deus [9] competed with the ultimate prize of being the supreme,
sole God on the line and started a war, along with their servants and
created beings.
This war lasted for a long, long time, so long it felt numbing.
There was no land that was not stained with blood, and cries of agony had
never ceased to echo through the skies.
The races with knowledge hated each other, slaughtered each other, and
continued to repeat their countless killings.
The elves had small villages as their bases, and they cast magic to hunt
their enemies.
The dragons used their bodies for killing purposes, and the warbeasts
devoured their prey like animals.
The land that was swallowed by the sunset and became a barren land was
swallowed by the deeper darkness due to the wars amongst the old Deus.
The 'Demon Lords' and their allied monsters that were created by the
Fantazma went rampant and dominated the land.
In this kind of world, no further numbers of nobility, beauties or even
warriors would work.
Humans were just an insignificant existence.
They had to bet their lives on building their countries and forming clans just
to survive.
The legendary hero who could be hailed by the bards did not appear—and
just like that, it was a blood-stained era.
This was a story that was far longer and older than the skies, seas and
land—called the 'Disconnect Board'.
However, the war they thought would continue for eternity suddenly ended.

The skies, seas, land—and even the stars that filled the skies.
They lost the will to continue this emaciated, weary war where they were it
was tantamount to die without benefits.
And just like that—at this point, the Old Deus with the most amount of
power left sat on the only throne for a sole God.
And so, this Deus who had been watching from the sidelines all this while...
Abstaining from the war from the beginning till the end.
The Deus sat on the throne, looking at the devastation on the land around
him.
He declared to all the people roaming on the land.
"—To everyone, who used up all extremes of strength, violence,
desperation, and death.
Show me proof that you, who built towers of corpses, are knowledgeable
beings as you so claim."
'What is the difference between you and the 'unintelligent beasts'?
All the races unanimously said that there was no need to prove their own
intelligence.
But, in front of this barren and abandoned world, this discourse was too
empty.
Ultimately, there was no answer that was accepted by God.
God said.
—From this piece of Heaven, I command that there will be no plundering or
bloodshed.
Those words became an [Oath], becoming the absolute unchanging law of
the world.
From that day onwards, [War] disappeared from the world.
But the population that considered themselves rational sent complaints to
god in unison.
Even if [War] has disappeared, [Conflict] still exists—

God said, in that caseThose of the [Sixteen Races] that claim to be the most intelligent creatures.
Those who use all extremes of your reason, intelligence, ability and
financial resources.
Build towers of wisdom, and through that thou shalt prove thy own
intelligence.
God took out sixteen chess pieces—and laughed maliciously.
Thus, the [Ten Oaths] were born, and [War] disappeared from the world.
All disputes were resolved by [Games].
That was the law of the sole God, and that God's name was—TET.

Part 2
Andalusia continent, the Kingdom of Elchea, the Capital-- Elchea.
An area limited to the southern part of the equator, stretching to the
northeast of the continent, was a small country that was located in the
westernmost part, but it was more accurate to say that it was a small city.
It was a country that had previously occupied half of the continent in
mythical times, but now it has lost its former glory.
What was left was the last of the once great empire— A small and
vulnerable country.
—More precisely.
This was also the last kingdom for the human species.
—At the outskirts of the city not far away.
A tavern and inn that could only exist in RPG games was the first floor of a
building.
There were two people who were surrounded by many viewers, two girls
that were currently playing a game on a table.
One of the girls looked to be around 15 or 16 years old, having red hair
while giving out a sense of elegance with her manners and dress.

As for the other person—
Although she looked very alike in age with the redhead, her temperament
and clothing gave out a sense of maturity in other peoples' points of view.
Wearing a black veil draped over her head, resembling a mourning
shawl—was a black-haired girl.
As for the ongoing game that they were having........it seemed to be poker.
Their expressions on both their faces were in deep contrast, with the
redhead having a stern look due to anxiety.
On the other hand, the deadpan poker face on the black-haired girl face
made everyone peek at the color of calmness.
Anyways—the red-haired girl was losing thoroughly.

"......Hey, can you hurry it up?"
"An, annoying. I am still thinking."
—It was a pub, and the already drunken audience roared with vulgar
laughter in the broad daylight.
This added a shade of distress onto the red-haired girl's face.
But in any case——the scene as of now emerged as bustling.
…………—
During a game that was held outside the pub.
Sitting at a table next to open air, a young girl who was wearing a hood
peered through the window from the side and said.
"........How.....lively.........what happened?"
"Ah? Don't you foreigners know at all?—-But then again, there isn't any
other human country left."
Sitting next to the girl who was peeping into the window, were two people
that were playing a game on the table.
Playing, were a teenage male who was also hooded just like the young
girl, as well as a bearded middle-aged man with a bulging beer belly.
The teenager replied.
"Ah—because we are from the countryside, we are not clear with situations
regarding the metropolis."
Coincidentally, both of them were also playing the same game as the ones
inside.......[Poker].
—Only, the bargaining chips they used were bottle caps.
Because of the remarks by that teenager, the middle-aged man said
doubtfully.
"The so-called humans that don't live in this country...........aren't they
hermits?"
"Haha, that is true. Okay, so what is all the commotion inside?"

The bearded man got shot back with the question after cleverly avoiding it.
".......Right now, there is currently a gambling tournament to [Elect the next
king] for Elchea."
With eyes watching the situation in the pub, the hooded girl continued
asking.
".......Elect........the next king?"
"Yes. These were the previous king's last words before dying."
[The next king shall not be inherited by blood relations, but the coronation
of "Humanity's strongest gambler".]
Continuing to add on the bottle caps, the bearded man said.
"In the fight to gamble for the country, the human species were defeated.
Now there is only Elchea, which is also the capital of this country—so there
was no time to look decent now."
"Huuu, [Gambling for the country], eh.......that seems to be something very,
very interesting."
The hooded teen replied.
He was very alike to the hooded girl, feeling very concerned and peeping
into the pub to look at the situation.
"—Well, why? Are those kids like the candidates to be the next king?"
"Un? The so-called word [Candidate] seems wrong, because as long as
you are a human, anyone is eligible to participate."
Just—adding these words, the man moved his line of sight towards the
tavern.
—Obviously playing poker, but she does not seem to know the meaning of
the word "poker face".
Giving a glance to the red-haired girl whose whining voice could be heard
and her intent while staring at the opponent's hand could be felt, the man
said.
"That red-haired girl over there is called "Stephanie Dora"— the previous
king's blood kin. If they followed his will, about a non-royal nor

blood-related person becoming the king, then she will lose everything, so
her goal is to become the next king."
The blood kin of that guy who made humanity lose, never expected to
have such desperate children......
Added the man before sighing, bluntly commenting on the noise inside.
".........Huuu....."
"Un.......[Gambling for the country]—even the so-called borders are
decided with games, right?"
The hooded girl and teen expressed their feelings.
The girl felt admiration.
The teen felt interest.
"Whatever the case, the system of the gambling tournament is heating up
considerably."
".........Round robin?"
"As long as you are a human, anyone can be the next king, so long as you
register your name. Regardless of the methods, it will be decided with a
game. The loser will be deprived of qualification while the last man
standing will be the king."
—So, the rules are simple. The easier it is to understand, the better it is.
But, the hooded teen doubtfully said.
"........It really is that casual, eh. Wouldn't there be any problems?"
"As long as you respect the [Ten Oaths], with both sides judging each
other, there would be no restrictions, nor any restriction on the competition
mode— Including who, what to use and at what time. After all, it is a
national gambling thing for the country."
"......No, I don't mean that."
The hooded teen muttered in an eloquent tone while looking into the pub
again.
The girl whispered to the teen.

".......Of course, total defeat."
"Ahh, we think of the same things."
Saying it to each other, the teen took out a square-shaped item from his
pocket.
Facing towards the tavern, he operated it for a while before it sounded with
a 'Kacha'.
—After that, the middle-aged man secretly laughed.
"So, little brother? It isn't the time for you to think of the outcome of other
people, right?"
Apologizing, the man suddenly spread out his cards.
"Full house. Sorry, eh."
The man who was convinced that he had won—thought of the people that
would be his later and leaked out a nasty smile.
—But, looking at the hooded teen.
He still showed that disinterested face he had since the start.
But now a reaction came and he gave out a response.
"Eh? Ah—sorry. Oh, yes."
Saying this, the teen casually revealed his poker and the middle-aged man
stared in disbelief.
"A roy, royal straight flush—!?"
Towards the man who stayed emotionless and yet received the best hand
in the game, the man got up and roared.
"You, you guys cheated me, right!?"
"Hey, hey, hey, how rude.......do you have any evidence?"
Facing against the teen who exposed a thin smile and was preparing to get
up from his seat, the man continued speaking mercilessly.
"The probability of getting a royal straight flush is only 1/650000, how could
you get it so easily!"

"Then today must be the day where I hit that 1 out of 650000 chances
right, Uncle? You really do have bad luck, eh."
Leisurely leaving behind this sentence, the teen spread his hands wide.
"Then, could you get me what you had "bet"?"
"—You deserve to die."
Clucking his tongue, the man took out his wallet and purse.
"Article six of the [Ten Oaths], 'As per the oath, the wager will be
unconditionally adhered to'— Okay, I will accept it."
".....Thank you......Uncle."
The hooded teen stood up casually after finishing and left.
After nodding with a bow, the girl started chasing after the figure of that
teen.
At that time, a figure that seemed to be a friend approached the bearded
man who was watching the two people stroll into the pub.
"Hey, although we were all watching from start to end, why did you have to
bet on "Everything you had"?"
"Ah.......Oh my God, what am I going to do about the living expenses."
"No, compared to that, what did they bet on, making you put up all your
living expenses?"
Sighing, the bearded man responded listlessly.
"They said [Free to do whatever you want with us two]."
"What—"
"Although I felt it was a little too fitting ......But I thought it would work
seeing that they are from the countryside.........So how?"
"You can't do anything about it.......Oh yeah, which one would you
choose?"
"—Ha?"
"But......bisexual or lolicon, both are out of your league, eh....."

"Wuh- hey, hey, wait a moment!"
"What, ah~ don't worry, I will keep it a secret from Kamei-san. As a
consideration, you have to treat me♪"
"No, not that! Moreover, my cash has already been taken away! Compared
to this—"
"The condition bet did not only include the girl's chastity, it was also
equivalent to [Betting two peoples' lives], but the case of getting a royal
straight flush while looking so absent-minded? What exactly is backing up
those two guys......"
—………
"........Nii.....cunning."
"Ah? Why did that come out from you too."
".......Deliberately using......that kind.......of cheat that sticks out by a mile."
—Yep, it was exactly what the man had said.
The royal straight flush could not have simply appeared that easily.
Coming up with this kind of hand was tantamount to declaring openly that
you were cheating.
But—
"Article eight of the [Ten Oaths], once cheating has been discovered in a
game, it will be deemed as a defeat—"
The teen muttered out the rule of this world he had just remembered.
"—Which means, as long as you are not found out then you can do it. Isn't
receiving acknowledgement nice."
The teen's argument revealed that he had only conducted a simple
experiment, before stretching his waist.
"Well, at least we earned some military spendings."
"........Nii............understands.....how the money works here?"
"It's impossible to know, right? But, leave this to me- this is within your
brother's field of expertise."

The teen said it with a tone that the bearded man and his friend had never
heard,
Before walking into the building that had the inn and tavern.

Part 3
Despite the bustling commotion due to the heated game on the central
table, two people walked to the counter.
Reaching the counter, the hooded teen took out his wallet from his purse
and emptied the coins out, before asking slowly.
"I'd like a room for two. One bed is enough. How many nights will this
amount of money get us?"
The figure which had a boss-like aura glanced over quickly.
After a moment of hesitation.
".........One day with three meals."
However, the hooded teen laughed towards this remark— and with his
eyes covered by the hood, continued talking.
"Ah haah~I said. Ah, after trekking for five nights straight, the fatigue is
enough to kill me. We are totally exhausted already—so could you quickly
tell me, [How many nights can we stay]?"
"—What?"
"Although we do look like country people who don't know the monetary
value, it's fine with me if you want to raise the price. But, I recommend that
when you lie, please take note of your line of sight and tone of voice, 'kay
~♪"
The teen laughed while saying these words- it appeared that his eyes had
a keen radiance that saw right through him.
With the boss sweating nervously, he sucked in his lips and replied.
".......Che. Two days, then."
"You see, lying again.....let's just compromise this- ten days with meals
provided, then."

"Wha! What kind of compromise is that!!? You, fine... three days with
meals, how meddlesome!"
"Ah, so it's like that, eh. Then a discount, five days with food attached."
"Wuh—"
"You are trying to deceive customers into pumping out their oil before lining
your own pockets with the money, then splurging it all, right?"
"Whu, wait, that sort of thing—"
"And you are the owner of this tavern but not the owner of the inn, right?
Should I report you?"
He had kept a smile on his face since the start of the conversation.
But facing against this teen who spared no pains to negotiate with him, the
boss could only make an awkward and stiff expression before replying,
"Little brother, you obviously have a worldly expression, but you're
unexpectedly ruthless, eh..........I get it, four days with meals provided,
how's that?"
"Okay~, thank you for the hospitality♪"
Still wearing that smile, the teen took the room keys from the man's hand.
"Your room's at the innermost corner on the third floor. What's........your
name?"
The hooded youth replied to the somewhat impatient boss who was
holding onto the register.
"Un~..........Kuuhaku[10] would do."
Sora purred and spun the keys on his fingers.
He suddenly patted the head of his little sister, who was ecstatically
watching the climax of the game on the central table.
"Look, I finished negotiations, we get to stay for four days. You may quickly
worship your onii-sama— what are you doing?"
Shiro was staring at that Stephen............something, the person introduced
by the bearded man early on.

A distressed expression was exposed on that girl's face.
Her askew expression made people think that that without a doubt, she did
not have a hope of victory.
"........That person— will lose."
"Probably. So what?"
Revealing her emotions without hiding them, even if there was a chance,
she still would not win.
Maybe it was as the bearded man had said, the lineage of the royal family
are stupid.
Just when this idea was emerging in Sora's mind—he realized.
"—Ah!"
Then, after figuring out the intentions of his sister's words, he could not
help but sigh.
"Whoa, so it is that kind of meaning……How scary……"
"..........Un."
Shiro was sizing up the black-haired girl while nodding at the sighing Sora.
"Really..........This world's cheating methods are truly incredible. I don't
even want to meet against these kinds of opponents......"
".........Nii, shameful....."
Probably provoking him, Sora suddenly got serious and countered back.
"Heh, don't be silly. No matter how clever a cheat is, it depends on how
you apply it."
"……Nii, could you.....beat it?"
"—But this really is worthy of a fantasy world, eh....... There really isn't any
sense of reality here, yet we both have a comfortable and relaxed
feeling........Is it because we've played too many games?"
Sora did not answer his little sister's question, but instead headed for the
third story of the building while rambling about non-related topics.

"...........Really, I asked........a stupid question."
Shiro suddenly apologized.
—Indeed, for 『

』, failure was almost impossible.

Then..........after making contact by the shoulders.
For some reason—Sora turned towards Steph..........whatever, the
red-haired girl.
He thought about it in his mind for a moment— before whispering softly.
".......Oh, come on...can't you see you're being cheated?"
"—Eh?"
The girl with the striking red hair and contrasting round blue eyes suddenly
glanced over.
Even as he felt the the girl who was mysteriously told off stare at his
moving figure.........Sora did not utter another word and went straight
towards the door of the room.

Part 4
Along with the turn of the key in the lock, came a lack of sense of security
when the metal hinge let out a squeaking sound before the door opened.
Inside the room— it was wood that was quite similar to the kind in Skyrim ,
making the house look kind of cheap.
The room was small, and creaking could be heard with every footstep on
the floor. The table and chairs that were arranged at the corners looked
very perfunctory.
As for the other things, there was only a bed and window. The interior was
quite simple.
Walking into the room and locking the door, the both of them removed their
hoods.
Wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers with matted black hair—Sora.
A mess of long white hair that covered her red eyes, a skinny girl who wore
a sailor uniform—Shiro.

Sora removed the borrowed robes that when worn, would not look
conspicuous in a world like this, before revealing a relieved look and threw
himself on the only bed.
Taking the phone out of his pocket— he checked off the task that was
planned beforehand.
"—[Goal]: Ensure accommodation—[Achieved]— it's safe to say *that*
now, right?"
"......Un[11], I think......we can."
After the confirmation, a thousand emotional words were released from the
heart.
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,so tired,
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh............."
These words......
It was decided early on to never say these until the goal was reached.
Afterwards, bursting out as he could no longer contain himself, were the
complaints about the story that came out of Sora's mouth.
"There is no such thing as [definitely impossible]- I can't believe that at our
first reunion with the outside world, we had to walk that far."
Similarly, taking off the robe revealed a folded white sailor uniform.
Opening the window, she confirmed the scenery.
From the window, you could barely see it— the cliff onto which they fell.
"........Humans, as long as they have the will, then it can be done."
"Yeah, if there is no motivation then nothing will be done— These realistic
words accurately express our current situation, eh."
Although it was such a negative interpretation— Shiro still nodded in
agreement.
"But I thought that my legs had become weak from being a hikikomori for
so long, so I never expected that we would be able to walk that far."
".........Because.....we control the mice.....with both our feet?"

"Oh— I see! The so-called 'mastering one skill so much until it carries into
everything else' thing was true then!"
".........That's not..........what I originally meant......I meant........"
This comical dialogue seemed to have reached its limit.
Shiro's eyes were half closed.
The little sister, who was staggering as if she was going to faint, fell on the
bed that Sora was on.
Although it didn't show on her face, the pained breath from her fatigue
could be felt.
—This was of course, a natural reaction.
No matter how much of a genius she was, she was still an eleven year old
girl.
Dueling in a chess match after 5 all-nighters was enough to shock anyone
with that kind of stamina. Even Sora also felt pain and shifted around
(although it was only halfway). For a person to also come here without
complaints was truly worthy of being marveled.
Because Sora had decided before not to utter out a single complaint.
"You worked hard. How great— indeed, you are your brother's prided little
sister."
As if combing his little sister's hair, Sora stroked her head and said that.
"........Un. Find a place to sleep.......made sure.........that was completed."
"Ahhh, and of course, I was thinking what was going to happen to us when
we were attacked by those thieves."
—With these words, Sora's mind drifted back to a few hours ago.
That is— when both of them were lost and wandering around shortly after
being dumped in this world.

Part 5
"—Then, what do we do."

"........(Shakes head)"
Waking up and regaining a conscious state for the second time.
While cursing in his heart that life was being too unreasonable, the
fatigued Sora shouted to the pedestrians passing by.
After Shiro was temporarily relieved, she let out a sigh.
Both of them felt weary, but they still recovered their composure despite
being exhausted.
Moving away from the edge of the cliff, they then slumped onto the
unpaved roadside.
".........Nii, why come.....here?"
"You see, in an RPG game this would be called a [Street] right? I
remember it was to let someone go through some sort of....."
Although they didn't know to what extent their practical knowledge about
games could help them, but this sort of things should be placed aside first.
"—Well, first things first, let's inventory what things we currently have on
hand."
Just like any survival play-off game, Sora said it like this.
Understanding the point, both of them started taking everything out of their
pockets.
What were taken out—
Were Sora and Shiro's respective smart phones, two of them.
Handheld game consoles, two of them.
Two multipurpose batteries. Two solar power chargers, with multiple
charging outlets.
And the last thing was a tablet PC in Shiro's hand.
.....No matter how you looked at it, it was hard to imagine lost victims with
such expensive equipment.
And— they were all used to play games.

Because no matter where they were, be it on the toilet or in the
bathroom—or even during a power outage, they could always play games,
so these were items that could not leave their persons.
——Actually, nobody knew whether or not these items could be useful in
an actual difficult crisis, they were mysterious and yet substantial pieces of
equipment.
"..........Sure enough, electrical waves and the like cannot be received in
the fantasy world."
Sora said, while looking at the display screen on his phone that told him he
was out of range.
—But, the backlight of the phone could be used as a flashlight at night, and
it could also take photos.
The map function—was of course ineffective, but it could still be used as a
compass.
Sora gave a heartfelt thanks to the recent high level performance
developments for smartphones.
"...........Okay, Shiro, turn off the phone and tablet PC. Take advantage of
the sun being up and charge the photo voltaic power generator. I
downloaded an e-book about games onto that tablet and in the worst case
scenario, we will just use the survival guide."
"........Roger—"
Shiro obediently listened to her brother's words and turned off the
equipment while using the solar charger to charge it up.
—When encountering unexpected circumstances, listening to her brother's
instructions was the best. Shiro knew this due to her own experience.
.........After that, using the power of science (Sora's phone), a direction to
head off was determined.
However, using the phone which only had a compass, their current status
was like being thrown into the sea without any nautical charts, so there
weren't any changes in the situation.
They were obviously holding the product of the most advanced scientific
technology, yet they still got lost in the way of life and fell onto the wayside.

"—Oh?"
Sora spotted a few people approaching from a side-street(or a Street),
pacing towards them.
"OHHH! How fantastic, my experience in RPGs really worked!"
".........Nii......they look......weird."
Finishing this sentence, the group suddenly picked up the pace and
enclosed them in a circle.
Dressed in green and easy to walk in boots—
"..........Wowhoa, aren't they thieves!"
Sora could not help but complain to the heavens.
Getting lost on the road and their first encounter was actually with [fantasy
world thieves!]
Facing against this ferocious bunch, in full accordance with a typical bad
guy group— Sora shielded Shiro with his body while really thinking of
cursing the heavens.
—But what came out of the thieves' mouths was.
"Hehe....if ya wanna get past— ya gotta play a game with us."
.............
This one sentence made the two siblings look at each other helplessly—
but.
"—This, eh...that brat did say that this was [A world where everything is
decided by games]."
"...........Is that......how thieves here........are?"
The two people who quickly accepted that fact compared the thieves from
here with the ones from their own world.
They couldn't resist but smile after the comparison. This could even be
described as a cute scene compared to an encounter with a real thief, thus
forcing both of them to break out in laughter.

"What are you guys laughing about! If you don't have a game with us, don't
even think about getting past here."
Facing against two people who were laughing for no reason were the
thieves.
The siblings then communicated with each other using a quiet voice that
the thieves couldn't eavesdrop on.
"One person deceived the others, then using cheats to cut off their escape
route— what do you feel?"
"............Is......good."
Finishing the conversation, Sora clapped his hands with a 'Pa!'
"OK, fine, let's have a showdown. But unfortunately for us, we are currently
penniless."
"Heh, no matter, then—"
But regardless of what the thieves said, Sora continued.
"If we lose then we are at your disposal, regardless of where we are sold to
or what is done to us."
"—Ah?"
The cheeky thief who was about to say out a proposal, was abruptly
interrupted, before getting surprised himself,
"In contrast, if we win—"
With a chilling smile on his face— the brother said.
"You will take us to the nearest street ♪, and give us the robes those two
are wearing. Because we are still wearing conspicuous clothing due to the
transfer of worlds, this is a must. And also about the game rules of this
world, truthfully tell them all to me☆"
Sora exerted his highly adaptable game brain.
He was already convinced that he would win and had even added some
additional requests.

Part 6

Thinking about back then, Sora whispered.
"[Ten Oaths]——eh. Shiro, do you remember?"
".......Un. Very..........interesting rules." Shiro, looking dazed and about to
fall asleep, replied.
They had learned about the rules of this world from the thieves (they were
no longer recognizable now) that had lost the game.
Taking out his phone on which he had written the rules, Sora reread them
out loud again.
【Ten Oaths】——
It appears that these were the absolute rules that [God] had laid down.
Although the little sister seemed to have easily memorized it, the brother
had still recorded them in his phone, which were as follows:
【1】 All bloodshed, war, and pillage is forbidden throughout the world.
【2】 All disputes are to be resolved through the outcome of games.
【3】 In games, wagers will be made on what both parties decide to be of
equal value.
【4】 Unless contrary to "Three", the game content and the things
wagered do not matter.
【5】 The challenged party has the right to decide the contents of the
game.
【6】 "As per the Oath", the wager will be unconditionally adhered to.
【7】 All matters for group conflicts will be decided by a representative.
【8】 If cheating is detected during a game, it will be regarded as a defeat.
【9】 The above rules are unconditionally everlasting, upheld in the name
of God.
"And 【Ten】—— Everyone should get along while playing games."
—…….
"Nine is used to wrap up everything from above it, but Ten......."

That is, it was not a mandatory requirement to get along with the opponent,
so to speak.
Or said in another way, 'Anyhow, it's not as if you guys are living in
harmony anyways'.
Feeling the irony of the 【Ten Oaths】, the mirthful face of that [God]
surfaced in Sora's mind.
"That kid that dragged us here into this world— if that person really is
[God], then he really does have good character.
Pocketing his phone, Sora said with a wry smile.
Just when the thought of lying on the bed came.
His fatigue suddenly welled up, and his consciousness began to blur, even
his thinking skills began to wear down.
"........If I think about it, of course it is a natural reaction. Pulling all-nighters
for five days and then the sudden onset of this event......"
"..........Fuu......."
Always thinking about being beside her brother, while clutching onto Sora's
wrist, was the little sister who had reached dreamland.
Sweeping away the bangs that were on her face revealed white skin that
was like ceramic and a beautiful face that was like a work of art.
Compared with the girl that had a doll-like refined appearance, saying that
both of them were siblings could be perceived as a start of a bad joke.
"—Didn't I always say to at least cover yourself with a blanket......you will
catch a cold."
".........Un."
Complying with her brother's words, the little sister used a feeble voice to
request him to help her cover herself.
Although Sora covered his little sister with the blanket that smelled like
dust with a bit of hesitation, he still thought it was better than nothing.
Watching his Shiro's sleeping face and steady breathing, Sora suddenly
became lost in thought.

(—Then, from now on, where should I start.....)
Sora started fiddling with the phone which he had just taken out.
He wanted to try and see if there was any software that could help his
predicament.
(—This is a fantasy about being pulled into a different world, so first I
should think about and look to see if there is a method to go back......)
—Parents who were no longer in this world.
—A sister who was not accepted by society.
—Himself who did not accept society.
—Besides, the surprise that lies beyond the screen— this world.
"........Hey, Shiro...the protagonists of alternate world stuff...why did they
want to return back to 'that' kind of world?"
Even though he knew that she had fallen asleep, Sora still tried to raise
this question, but he did not receive an answer.
He thought about what he was going to do after the four days.
Sora was going to try and improvise— but before the conclusion of his
contemplations, the demon of sleep had already cut off his thoughts.

Part 7
—'Tok Tok!', this kind of sound rang in the air.
The reason why he would wake up only due to polite knocking—
Was because his senses had been sharpened due to coming to an
unknown place.
Sora loudly commanded the urges that wanted him to go back to sleep to
shut up, then quickly let his brain become active again.
".....Nyaaa~."
—But his little sister was different from him.
There was drool dribbling down her face and she was tightly grabbing onto
her brother's left arm while sleeping.

With a face that was more comforting than anything else, it would have
made anyone jealous of the one who got to see that dreaming expression.

"Yeah, thinking about it, in this world, killing, looting, and other things are
prohibited......."
Which means— things such as being vigilant, are not necessary in this
world.
Probably understanding this point— no, she certainly understood.
Sora, who looked like he had adapted to this world, gave a wry smile to his
little sister who was in a deep sleep and showed that comfortable
expression.
"Indeed, the degree of flexibility in my mind can't match up to hers......"
—'Tok Tok!'
Hearing the gentle knocking sound again, Sora replied.
"Ah- coming, coming. Who is it?"
"I am Stephanie Dora. I have something I would like to ask you regarding
the thing about today....."
........Stephanie.......Ah!
Taking out his phone, Sora confirmed the photos that were taken before.
What was shown on the photo was someone with red hair and blue eyes,
similar to a noble girl.
Yes, the pub downstairs— was also a venue for games to elect a new king.
"Ah, coming, I am opening the door."
".......Miwuuuuu...."
"—My little sister, it is a brother's blessing for you to stick to me like that,
but could you let go of my arm for a while? Otherwise I can't open the
door."
".......?.......What?"
Although Shiro was in a half-asleep state, she still let go of Sora's arm.
Dragging his heavy body off of the bed, Sora stepped onto the wooden
floors that creaked and proceeded to open the door.

Appearing at the door was an appearance that was a far cry from the
photo on the phone— A [Stephanie] that looked like she had suffered a
huge blow.
"—Can you let me in?"
"Ah. Ermm, okay."
In short, Stephanie was then invited into the room.
Sora then retrieved the chair from the corner of the room.
He then sat on the chair because his little sister who was sleeping drowsily
on the bed kept shifting positions.
The first to open her mouth was Stephanie.
"..........What exactly happened?"
"—What? Ah, let me start first, because we are siblings, this is not what—"
"....Guu......dumped, by Nii......"
—Correction.
Apparently not half asleep— but Shiro who was 80% in sleep mode
applied more pressure onto Sora's back.
Although they did not know what the common sense was like here, a
tentative explanation was still needed.
"Then— is it wrong? I'm Sora. The years I've been without a girlfriend
equals my age, and I'm currently seeking a girlfriend right now, whoa♪"
".............That doesn't really matter at all."
But Stephanie completely ignored the meaning of this sentence and feebly
continued.
"More importantly, I want to ask about something that happened during the
day."
(Day— day. Un, what was that again?)
(Speaking of which, what's the time now? I can't even see the sun coming
through the windows—)

Taking a glance at the phone, he saw that 4 hours had passed since the
start of the rest— They had probably been sleeping for this long.
"Today, right when you had brushed past my shoulders, you said to me
something like 'Can't you see you are being cheated?'."
Just when Shiro was grumbling vague nonsense, probably something
about the current conversation, she closed her eyes and spoke.
".......So you.......really lost?"
Stephanie seemed to be agitated by Shiro's attitude.
"—Yes.........yes, that's right, I LOST! Now, just about everything is over!"
Sora covered his ears to muffle the shouting coming from Stephanie, who
had abruptly stood up.
"Ah— because of my lack of sleep, the sound will echo back and forth in
my head, so please refrain from shouting so loudly........."
Towards Stephanie who threw a heated temper tantrum that included
banging the table with her purse, Sora made only a small and humble
request, but evidently it didn't pass her ears, and she started crying with an
even sharper voice.
"Since you knew that the opponent was cheating, wouldn't it have been
good for me if you had explained the cheat to everyone?! I could have won
if you had exposed the truth!"
Sora then remembered what he had read before going to sleep, and said.
"Eh........ number eight of the [Ten Oaths]: if cheating is detected during a
game, it will be regarded as a defeat..."
Which is to say, you win if you clearly know that you are being cheated.
But she failed to realize— if it cannot be proved, the person cheating
wouldn't be defeated.
"I lost, thanks to you! Arghhh, now I am even eliminated from the
competition for the throne!"
"......So..........."
The drowsy Shiro spoke with a lisp.

".......So you lost.........and were in denial.............so you came here.........to
vent?"
Hearing Shiro's blunt and unabashed opinion, the blood pressure that
spiked as a result forced Stephanie to grind her teeth.
"Ah~my little sister, can we not pour oil on the fire while pretending to be
asleep?"
"...........Guu........why did..........you reveal that?"
"You woke up after I said [Looking for girlfriend]............furthermore, we
don't really have any companions here, sooo, we really should be more
friendly—"
—But.
Sora suddenly stopped speaking.
An idea— surfaced in his mind.
Probably seeing the idea forming in her brother's mind, Shiro became
silent.
On the other hand, Sora, who seemed like he had changed his mind, said
with a sardonic smile.
"—But, what my little sister said was also true. Humans who always fail are
taken for granted."
"........What did you say?"
The shocked Stephanie's mouth gaped.
But Sora disregarded her shock, and deliberately using vulgar eyes,
looked up and down Stephanie's body.
Just like a fantasy world Ojou-sama, she wore a fluttering dress that had
lace everywhere.
Sora's eyes seemed to be licking her body, observing her voluminous
figure that couldn't be hidden even if she wore a dress.
Carefully selecting words that would set off the opponent— Sora said.
"Not even being able to see through cheating of that degree, and then
suddenly running here to have a tantrum..........you're even getting angry at

a child hitting the nail— you really are a simpleton. And if you are really the
lineage of that foolish old king, then I suppose failing would be something
natural for you."

Part 8
Sora said this with eyes that were filled with a pity reserved for extremely
unintelligent organisms.
Widening her eyes, trembling while directing a burning death glare towards
Sora, another furious expression emerged on Stephanie's face.
"Please........take that back."
"Take it back? Haha, why?"
"Be as it is— I definitely won't allow you to ridicule my dear Ojii-san!"
Facing against Stephanie's solemn protesting, Sora only scoffed and
waved his hands.
"The reason why you didn't notice that cheat, was because you were too
defensive— rather than taking risks, you tried to choose a safer way to win.
These kind of people concentrate too much on securing themselves that
they don't even have the spare capacity to pay attention to the opponent's
actions."
He gave a sarcastic smile while tossing out these cheeky words.
"A simpleton with a low boiling point that can't even control your own
emotions because you're so conservative. IMHO[12], that is simply out of
the question for a gamer!"
"—Be quiet, if I wanted your opinion, then—"
Preventing his escape from the chair, Stephanie was in a posture like she
was ready to grab hold of Sora, but Sora still continued to speak.
"Then, let's play a game."
"......Eh? What?"
Stephanie was suddenly confused. But she remained vigilant and
questioned Sora about what he had just said.

"Nothing, it doesn't really require any complex thinking. It is just janken[13].
Heard of it? Janken."
"Janken—? That.....un, I know."
"Un, this world is indeed a great help. Then we will use that to determine
the winner, just that—"
Saying that, Sora put up his fingers.
As if saying it carefully for Stephanie to hear, Sora slowly continued.
"Not ordinary janken— do you understand? I will only use paper."
"—Ah?"
"If I were to throw anything other than paper, then I would [Lose]........but, if
I beat you with something other than paper, you will also lose, leading to a
[Draw]. Of course, if I throw out anything other than paper and I draw, then
I will still [Lose]."
"—"
(Losing if it isn't paper? What does this guy think he's saying?)
Stephanie became more alert.
"—The wager, what will it be?"
It was such a big help of you to be so sensible— Sora thought about
saying this, then smiled and replied.
"If you win, I will accept all of your requests. Whether you want me to tell
you the reason you lost, or the truth behind that cheat, or even if you want
me to die in repayment for calling your foolish king a foolish king, it doesn't
matter."
"......Youuuuu!"
"—So! Conversely, if I win, you must accept all of my demands."
Sora looked happy, but he had on an expression that was colder than ice,
with a creepy smile that had emerged.
Using a tone that was dirty, ugly, and cold, Sora continued speaking.

"We are betting our fates here— so it's not a problem for you to wager your
chastity, right?"
All of the hot blood gushing into Stephanie's head was calmed down due to
this coldness.
But, because Stephanie's mind had calmed down, she prudently
questioned.
"What if— we draw?"
"Then I will give you a little hint on how you were cheated......as
consideration."
Sora's attitude suddenly changed, and as if troubled, scratched his head
and said with a smile.
"I can make do with a trivial wish. Although what we have on hand seems
like it'll last us a few days— I'll be straightforward, after four days of staying
here, we'll have no food or place to stay. And in the long run, we are still
worrying about what to do next......."
"—Which means, you want me to provide you with accommodations."
Towards Stephanie's reply, Sora only returned a smile..
—Nothing was said.
Which means that this man was temporarily trying to scrounge a little bit.
"So, how do you feel~? Accept, or deny?"
"........"
"Well, even if you learn how the opponent cheated, you are already
disqualified from the throne selection. Not to mention that there is no
benefit to taking an unnecessary risk if you are someone who loves a
defensive war! So even if you refuse it's nothing."
Sora brazenly provoked her.
Despite it being such a blatant provocation— Stephanie still accepted it
without flinching.
".......Okay, let's do this then— 【Acciente】!!!"
—That was an oath to make sure the game followed the [Ten Oaths].

A word that declares full intention to God to perform a wager in absolute
compliance to the [Ten Oaths]— swearing to God, the absolute
requirement when gambling.
"OK, then I shall also- 【Acciente】."
Sora gave a leering smile— that vow from his mouth was both
unpredictable and askew.
In Stephanie's mind, she began thinking intensely.
(—Only throw out paper?)
(Unless he thinks that I would cheerfully throw out scissors.)
(Looking at the conditions he suggested— his intentions are obvious.)
(The goal of that man— is to reach a tie.)
(This man is only trying to get food and accommodation— he doesn't really
understand the cheat.)
(This should not be the truth now.)
(If he would lose if he doesn't use paper, then my chances of winning
are—)
Rock: 2 wins, 1 loss. Scissors: 2 wins, 1 draw. Paper: 1 win, 2 draws.
(He announced that he wouldn't choose anything other than paper.)
(If I innocently sent out scissors, he would choose rock.)
(He plans on mocking me by saying "Haha, just as I expected~ It was hard
on you, you single-celled idiot".)
(But if that was so, if I used paper— it would be impossible for me to lose.)
(But it would still fulfill his goals if the result was a draw.)
(—This man, definitely thinks that I won't use rock—.)
(Because, that's the only choice that I have with a possibility of losing!)
(—Treating me like an idiot!)
(Both rock and scissors are good, my chances of winning are [2:1])

(Thinking as you wish— I will not let you get away with a draw!)
Trying to penetrate through Sora, Stephanie stared at him with sharp eyes.
"——"
—However, Stephanie, who looked at Sora's expression, could not help
but take a deep breath.
Because there was a skinny man that was troublesome— or not.
Calmly, the man that was confident that he would win revealed a faint
smile.
Seeing Sora's expression— blood rushed into Stephanie's head once
again, as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on her.
(—No, don't be impetuous, keep calm.)
Finishing those words in her head, Stephanie started brainstorming again.
Rashness, emotions and simplicity- what if he sees through all of these?
Stephanie said to herself and noticed something.
—Right.
This, of course, was an obvious matter.
(This guy—this man—declared that paper was the only exception!)
(In addition, no matter what other method he uses, he can not [Win].)
(So— no matter what I choose, this man only announced that he would
choose [Paper].......)
(Victory would come to him if he happens to get a lucky draw and a tie
would be expected— that's right!)
(The possibility of losing— is the same no matter what!)
"Then, should we start?"
Sora asked with the air of winner— but.
"Yeah, you too. Are you prepared to comply to the Oaths?"
Likewise, Stephanie who believed that she would win, replied.

(I have already seen through your tricks— go on and put on the expression
of a lost dog[14]!)
"Then let's begin, ready, saisho wa guu[15]—"
—Rock.
Stephanie had used [Scissors].
"What—"
—Widening her eyes because Sora had chosen [Rock].
"Whu, What— Wh, Why.......like this....."
"Although it is laudable that you honestly came out with rock and did not
give into the provocation— in the end you are still too inexperienced."
Saying that— the ruthless edge and thin smile disappeared from Sora's
face.
Sora sat on the bed again, and lightly talked through the inner thought
processes of Stephanie to her.
"My provocation was to make rock appear to you as the only way you
could lose."
"........"
"—But my calm expression drove in an understanding that only by using
paper would I [Win]."
"—Wha......I was being read— So that expression.......was all an act!?"
"So far so good......But choosing [Paper] would have made me
lose........this way, not only would you defeat my only chance of winning,
you could also double your possibility of winning against me."
—Everything was seen through- no, everything was manipulated by him.
"Guuu—"
Stephanie bit her lips and knelt down with her hands supporting her body.
The calming down process.....not only that, but even the winning idea that
Stephanie had thought out was also predicted.

—Finally, this.
The reason why Stephanie lost during the day- this was the hint.
However, Sora continued.
"So, yeah, it was already decided that I would win from the outset of this
game."
"I know. You were aiming for a draw, right? Okay, what
accommodations—"
Stephanie who had lost casually replied- but.
"Well, about that right there. You're wrong, you know?"
".......Ah?"
"Try re~ally hard to recall it, okay? How did I say it?"
"I can make do with a trivial wish. Although what we have on hand seems
like it'll last us a few days— I'll be straightforward, after four days of staying
here, we'll have no food or place to stay. And in the long run, we are still
worrying about what to do next......."
"Right, there's a problem here! When...did I ever say what the specific
contents of my [Trivial wish] were?"
"...................Ah!?"
Stephanie hurriedly got up and protested.
"Eh, because, didn't you already affirm that you only required
accommodation!?"
"Un, but I didn't confirm it~"
Stephanie tried to recall what had happened like a video playback with
sound, fully utilizing her mind.
With no place to stay, no food, how did he conceal the next words.
Sora—this man—had only....
Smiled.
—So the reason for his wishful thinking was to scrounge for more—

"Ah—ah—"
"Looks like you understand! Then please listen carefully to my [Trivial
wish]♪"
With Sora wearing a smile, 'Sha'— he suddenly pointed his finger towards
Stephanie.
"Fall in love with me!"

Part 9
………………—
.......A long silence.
The first to break the awkwardness, the one who was always silent, was
Shiro who watched innocently from the sidelines.
".......Erm, Nii?"
"Hehehe, what is it, my little sister. Was my plan so perfect that it moved
you to speechlessness?"
Although he could not understand his little sister's intentions, Sora was
already intoxicated with his perfect command.
【6】 "As per the Oath", the wager will be unconditionally adhered to.
Also considering the case of the ninth Oath— because of God's power, the
order couldn't be stopped by anything.
Well, of course, that also includes the individual's free will!
But—
"........That.........is..........what is going on..........?"
Facing against his little sister who was simply clueless, Sora also made an
expression as if he did not understand anything.
"Oya, it really is surprising that you don't understand, my little sister. Isn't
there a saying that 'love is blind'? If it is in absolute compliance with the
Oaths, then of course she would have to completely [Dedicate herself] to
me, right? Accommodation, money, even talent can be gained...isn't this
killing three birds with one stone♪"

Sora said it like this, wondering why she couldn't understand even though
she had such a good mind.
Shiro muttered softly.
"......."Become my property".......wouldn't that........do?"
"———Nn?"
".........For that........you.........get everything."
"—Eh, ah.....ehhhh?"
Sora was confused for an instant. After that he started accelerating his
thinking process.
If it was just as his little sister had said, the command of [Become my
property]...
Everything that belongs to a property naturally belongs to its master—
"Ah, eh? Wouldn't that kind of way be much more favorable.......huh?"
(Why didn't I think of that——?)
Shouldn't he have said that.
Planning policies had always been thought out by himself since the
beginning, so why would Sora, who claimed that he had the performance
and strength, do that—
"...............Nii......your own wish..........was mixed inside?"
"——Ahhhh......."
Shiro— gazed coldly at him with half-closed eyes, and not because she
was still drowsy.
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
Sora cried and hugged his head.
"I, I actually.........turned out to be like this!? Was it about that- if I missed
this chance, I'll never get a girlfriend?! Did the superficial sense of
inferiority of not having a girlfriend cloud my judgement at the last minute!?
No, im...impossible......how could I, I make such a silly mistake—"

Impossible.
For one of the wings of 『

』 to commit such a mistake— Sora felt dizzy.

As if she was unhappy with something, Shiro continued to said with her
cold voice.
"......Nii.........you said you had......no need for a girlfriend.................that as
long as Shiro was here.......that would be good enough............"
"That was me saying too much! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I am so sorry,
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
With his little sister pouting on the bed, Sora knelt in front of her as if in a
devout kind of worship and apologized.
"Af, after all I am unable to do those kind of things to my little sister! You
are only 11 years old! If I did it, I would be taken away by the cops! And
with your brother of age, this sort of desire is natural—"
Sora who was chattering all kinds of excuses. And Shiro who was staring
with cold eyes.
Furthermore,
"—"
After being requested to fall in love, Stephanie was thrown aside and had
her head lowered while trembling.
Yes. Just as Sora had thought, there could be absolutely no refusal to the
Oaths. Which was this world's absolute law.
But— her cheeks were burning, and the rapid beating of her heart could
not be stopped.
Because Sora had ignored her to talk to his little sister, Stephanie felt
worried.
—Even if this was the law of this world.
No.
Because of this man.
Because of this guy.

—She actually— "felt jealous"—!
"How can I acknowledge thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis!"
"Whoa, that scared me!"
With the force built up from her anger, Stephanie finally shrieked out.
Intending to resist the implanted feelings, she glared at Sora— but.
"—Wh, whoaa!"
When their eyes met, her heartbeat suddenly quickened and her face
became hotter.
"Wh, wha, what what what kind of [Trivial wish] was that! You, you dare toy
with a maiden's heart!?"
To try and avoid this effect, Stephanie changed her line of sight and
shouted.
Despite standing up aggressively, she still lacked a bit of momentum.
"Ah, that........about that......."
Sora scratched his cheeks, and shifted away his eyes with an
embarrassed look on his face.
He had originally wanted a development to happen, but due to his huge
mistake, some of his goals were not achieved and Sora could not help but
be worried.
"That, about that, Shiro? What do I do?"
"........I.....don't know....."
"Guuuuuu......"
Losing face and seeking help from his little sister, only to be coldly cast
aside—
"What a pain— *cough*!"
No matter. Sora, who had finally made up his mind, coughed.
He decided to treat the mistake as if it did not even happen.
Sora, feeling good again, could not help but giggle.

"The definition of trivial depends on the person. You wanted one bite of the
dessert, but that one bite was the whole thing[16]..."
Probably back to his normal state, Sora fluently said this.
"Isn't, isn't that a fraud!"
But, Stephanie didn't accept his form of interpretation and strongly
rebutted.
—The voice of Sora that flowed into her ears made her feel embarrassed.
Even though she really hoped that he would close his mouth, the problem
was that she actually wanted to listen to his voice.
Using a [Request for an explanation] as an excuse to try and do this, she
repressed the entanglement in her heart and retorted.
With absolutely no idea of how to deal with the kind of feelings entangling
in Stephanie's heart(nor any reason to), Sora (eighteen years old, virgin)
calmed down.
And as if pointing out a childish mistake, he pointed to Stephanie.
"Yup, right there. You were paying attention to the content of the game, yet
you ignored the [Premise] of it. That won't do, without any specific nature
of this statement........for example, even if an alarmist emphasizes on
hearing the winning conditions, sometimes their focus will deliberately get
fuzzed up, get it~"
—After all, the purpose of this game was to have a draw.
That was what Stephanie had thought so far.
But that was still not enough, there were still parts that weren't thought of.
Whether he won or drew— Stephanie's risks were the same.
This was the true point of the game— which is to say—
"You, you— swindler!"
Yes, the so-called [Fraud].
There was indeed a reason for why Stephanie had shouted— however.

"Oioi, saying that is too over the top~ obviously it was the fault of the one
being cheated~"
"Th, these are the lines of a swindler!"
Facing against Stephanie, whose protests were never ending, the clamor
finally drove Shiro to speak.
"........Of the [Ten Oaths].....Three......In games....... wagers will be made
on what both parties decide to be of equal value."
Because Shiro finally changed back, Sora ecstatically continued.
"Yes! The main point is 'to be of equal value'. After that, four: unless
contrary to "Three", the game content and the things wagered do not
matter— which is to say?"
Moving her fingers around, Shiro answered.
".......Life.......and human rights........can be wagered......."
"Yes, exactly♪ Which means that when the bet was decided, the game had
already begun."
As if explaining to Stephanie, only the conversation between the siblings
could be heard.
Shiro then said.
"..........But........it wasn't necessary..........to even wager feelings."
"That's not it! This was to confirm if even free will and resistance could be
dominated over—"
".......Nii."
"Sorry."
It appeared that the effect of 'treating the mistake like it never happened'
did not work on his little sister.
"But, but—! Using this kind of fraud—!"
With fraud, forcing her first love to be—
Stephanie, who rebutted in tears, originally wanted to raise cruel
accusations.

But"........Sixth of the [Ten Oaths].......the wager.........will be unconditionally
adhered to......."
The eleven-year old girl— with eyes filled with compassion and calmness,
issued the final blow.
"...........Easily forgetting the weight of the premise.........falling to the
provocation......that was all you."
—Yes, the Ten Oaths had to be followed.
【5】 The challenged party has the right to decide the contents of the
game.
Stephanie had the right to refuse the game, and also the right to change its
content.
The one who wasted those rights, submissively offered a wager, and
accepted the game was not anybody else—
"—Guuu....."
—It was Stephanie herself.
Perhaps having nothing else to say, Stephanie planted her rear end on the
ground.
In fact, the Oaths that were set up— were currently influencing Stephanie.
These Oaths were legitimately recognized by the world of this game.
No matter what Stephanie said, she had already lost, and the bet had been
established.
"Then, I guess you have accepted it, Stephanie?"
"—Guuu.......you.....!"
Rubbish! Was what she had intended to add on.
—But her feelings did not allow her to do so.
Not only that, a sweet feeling went into her heart just by being called by
her name—

"—Guu— why is this happening, agghhhhhhhhhhh!"
With a fire that couldn't be released, Stephanie got into a kneeling posture
and used her head to repeatedly bang the ground.
"Whoa— are, are you alright!?"
"How do I look alright to you!?"
Trying to ignore the pain of her slowly swelling forehead, Stephanie glared
at Sora, which made him cringe. However.
"No, not at all. B-but I did win the bet, so— can I make a request?"
Request—
Yes...after all, Sora's motive was not for her to fall in love with him, but for
the things that resulted from that.
Stephanie then remembered what he had said earlier, that love would lead
to her dedication.
However— hold on, Stephanie.
Sora's request was to 'fall in love with him'.
But not to 'follow his orders', right?
In other words, Stephanie had no obligation to accept any of his requests.
"Well......hehehe, looks like you had a miscalculation......."
Understanding this, then everything was very simple.
No matter what requests were put forward, just answer [NO!] and
everything would be settled.
Doesn't that solve everything!
"Okay. First of all, because Stephanie is too long, can I shorten it to Steph
instead?"
"Hmmm? Ah, okay, no problem at all♪— ahh!"
—Gaining a new nickname, [Steph] smiled and nodded.
The rationality and resolution to [Reject everything] two seconds ago had
completely disappeared.

The maiden who had turned simple due to love and would inevitably blush
when getting called by a nickname—
"Nu—noo, nam..name, there is nooo.....need to be worried.....about
call....calling me by a nickname......! Names don't matter! Un un, just like
that, un! Then after that I'll be fine if I just don't accept any other requests!"
But Steph who constrained herself to agree did not realize.
As long as she hurriedly escaped from this room, nothing else would
happen.
Which is to say— she unconsciously had a desire to stay by Sora's side.....
"Un, well, it would be great if you could call me Sora. Steph, you are of
royal lineage, right?"
—Here it comes.
Right, if the motive was support, then he'll demand money,
accommodation and food.
He would do this in order to get those things.
However, these requests that were going to be made, did not bind Steph to
comply to his demands.
Hehe, Steph laughed in her heart.
If Sora requested, she would bluntly reply with a 'I refuse!'.
Let this swindler have a feeling of defeat— and his expression would be
worth watching at that time.
With her corresponding lines ready, Steph waited for Sora's request.
"In that case, your house must be very spacious. Can we stay with you for
a while?"
"—Ah, okay, no problem❤"
—…… ..
Eh?
"Eh, ehhhh? Why? Hmm?"

Steph fell into disarray because she did not understand what she had just
said.
However, her face had such a fiery feeling that she was going to have a
nosebleed, which then prompted Steph to think back to Sora's words.
'Can we stay with you'—
That means staying together.
Cohabitation......which means a man and a woman living together.
Being able to stay together.
Which means......along with the bed, the bathroom and the like could be
shared—
"Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, not right! This is not right! It's not
that way!"
Watching Steph continuously headbutting the wooden wall with a 'Dong
Dong Dong'- Sora, who was scared pale, asked.
"Uh, umm, how do I say this...even though the situation has become very
strange...........is it okay?"
"How could this do!— ahhh.............everything is already useless........"
Steph faced the ceiling and gave a hollow laugh.
—Yup, Sora did commit a huge mistake.
Presenting requests without any [Contractually obligation].
But Sora's age equals how long he's been without a girlfriend.
He can't understand Steph because she is experiencing her first love.
Historically, love has been one of the reasons countries have fallen to ruin.
—This is just too contemptuous.

Part 10
"He, hehe........enough..........I give up, I don't care anymore, I will do
anything you want."

Lying on the wooden floor, the frustrated yet sobbing Steph said.
Even though she wasn't bound contractually, she had already shown no
will to refuse any orders.
Steph realized this point, and with expressionless eyes, said this while
stifling her laughter.
"—No more other requests? Oh, whatever, I don't care anymore."
—
Reaching this point, there was something missing in Steph's
considerations.
Because she never expected to be asked to 'fall in love with him', just grant
to requests.
"Ah—........um, yes....."
Sora gave a glance to Shiro.
What the meaning behind that glance was, Steph wasn't sure of.
Shiro softly nodded.
".........Waiting.......for Shiro to be eighteen......Nii........is too pitiful."
"Could you please not use the word 'pity' to describe it? And also, don't you
know that even when you're eighteen, your brother still can't do anything to
his little sister?"
".....So."
Shiro squeezed her thumb in between her index and middle fingers, and
said with a deadpan expression.
".........Nii.......grats.....on your graduation from virginity."
"—Whu-"
—Yes.
Was it because the development was too good, or did it simply lack
imagination.
Requesting the body, this development was of course natural.

Steph, who had entirely abandoned her will earlier, had the flaming light of
resistance lit up in her yet again.
"Wha, whu whu, what? I, I, I didn't listen to it before! Thi, thi, for this kind of
thing, there must be a certain atmosphere, a situation where it is natural—
ah? Huh?"
However, the reason her eyes had regained their light was not due to the
fear of her losing her virginity— strange.
—She was looking forward to it. Steph, who had noticed this, once again
tried to drive her head into the wall.
Sora was completely oblivious towards Steph, who was carrying these
subtle thoughts while ramming her head, and flatly said.
"No, until Shiro is eighteen years old, all R-18 things and everything related
is banned."
"—Eh?"
Steph whispered, but it was still heard.
"........Don't mind......Shiro....."
"But I do mind a lot! I will absolutely not allow children to see pornographic
scenes!"
"........Nii...........didn't you just tell her.........to fall for you..........because
you're bad with rape.........and the like, right?"
"No, that...why do you understand my sexual preferences?"
"........The game boxes............leaving them and the games.....and
everything else around the room...............I know everything."
Steph was dumbfounded just by listening to the siblings' dialogue.
But, both parties have been ignoring this fact.
—Their arguments about M-18 related stuff stemmed from the fact that the
[Sister was accompanying them].
"—Um, wouldn't it be settled if you let your sister out of the room?"
"Hmm? Although I am quite happy that you are looking forward to it, that
can't be done due to complicated circumstances."

"—NO! Nooo, are you stupid? Are you an idiot!?"
Tossing aside the flushed Steph.
Just like a scholar who tried to find a solution to an enormous problem.
Both of them, who were brooding and folding their arms, finally seemed to
have an intelligent look on their faces.
".........Then."
Saying this, Shiro expressionlessly came up with a solution.
"......Then barely safe for work..............take action."
"Ohhh! This one! As expected of my little sister, indeed you are talented."
".......Eh?"
Hearing the words of praise coming out of Sora's mouth, Shiro revealed a
joyous expression.
Also— she didn't understand it at all.
It looked like they had found "the method to achieve the objectives" that
complied with the 'little sister accompanies', which alerted Steph.
"—But, to what kind of extent?"
".......Nii, this type of field[17]...is complacent....."
"We had encountered this "Type of field" in mangas and games, but this
kind of matter doesn't apply to me, which I will clearly state first, my little
sister."
".......Because............you're a virgin.......so you don't know...........what to
do?"
Saying this accurate, yet bitter statement to Sora, Shiro raised up her
smart phone.
"........Shiro will give instructions.....while videotaping........"
"Un, instructions are fine, but why is the camera necessary, little sister?"
"........Nii.......don't you want fap material......?"

"Un, although the thoughts you have worry me...but I will gratefully accept
your thoughtfulness."
With mixed feelings, Sora turned towards Steph.
On the other hand, Steph was unaware of what the smartphone was and
froze motionlessly.
Starting the video, Shiro gave the first set of instructions.
".........Take...one.....starting from.....suddenly.........falling down?"
"Oh— so it'll be that kind of development, eh. Erm.........how do I fall in this
kind of situation—"
Sora was searching around for something that he could stumble on, when
slowly.
".........Un."
Shiro gently kicked him.
"Whoa— so that's how it is, oh— I'm gonna fall!"
Sora said, as he skillfully read Shiro's intentions.
"—Ah?"
With mediocre, or perhaps even worthless acting, Sora pushed Steph until
they hit the floor.
His hands that were pressing on Steph—
—Were in the same place as in any conventional storyline, unto Steph's
breasts.
If there was one word that Steph would use to describe the situation, to let
others understand this kind of "rotten and vulgar development"— it would
be the word "violent".
"........Take....2...........because of a force majeure[18], he groped them..."
"That......if it was accidental then it wouldn't be a force majeure......"
"......Then.......are you giving up?"
"I'll do it, director. I will work hard— sex!"

Grope grope grope. Grope grope grope.
Grope grope grope. Grope grope grope.
Shake shake shake. Shake shake shake.
Shake shake shake. Shake shake shake.
"Wah......"
His thoughts frozen, the sensation of the rather plump feeling caused Sora
to be speechless and he could only say an interjection.
On the other hand, Steph widened her eyes, but it eased down.
Because the reason why she could not catch up with the development—
Was this point, which of course was one of them.
But above all else— experiencing the feeling of being touched by his
hands, Steph did not know why she felt like she was going to melt.
"—Wuu......ah~"
The sound that leaked out from Steph's mouth was covered by her hands,
fortunately unheard by those two peoples's ears.
"—Well, well, well........3, 3D isn't all that bad after all........uh— errr,
director. This level still counts as [All ages], right?"
".....Un.....but, Nii........too much groping........"
In other words, flat as a board."Oh— is that so. Since the groping was an
accident, it would still be a bit rotten and vulgar even if it is 3D— then, guu,
what to do next? Director."
"......Take.....3, from here, nipslip."
"Is that still safe for work?"
Sora could not help but raise that question, while Shiro solemnly said.
"........If it is by J*MP standards..........then even being fully
naked........doesn't matter......"
"No no, it will be bad if it was fully naked! Is there really such a thing as a
nipple in reality?"

"......The...........video, will be cropped, and altered........"
"Director, this is live. The situation is happening now. You can't white-out
or alter that."
"..........Then.........underclothes?"
".......Ah, if it is to that degree— but it is difficult to undress in this situation."
Facing Sora who appreciated the pains of making a film, Shiro said.
".........Nii, not above..............if it's, below."
"Ah, flipping the skirt will also cause light blockage! You really are capable
to a high degree, director."
Just when Sora stretched his hand to lift up Steph's skirt.
Steph, whose brain had already melted, started to reignite.
—Flip.....skirt?
Underclothes— which means that my panties will be seen by him?
—No, I will be troubled by this.
The top is fine.
No, the top is not fine.
It was not just the residual effects of Steph's rational side. But it was also
her instincts that warned her.
The bottom is not fine.
It can't be fine, unacceptable in any case. At least for now, it is
unacceptable.
Well, how to say it better.
—Although it was implanted feelings.
To be pushed down by the person you liked, even groped by him.
Because when the inevitable would happen— there would be a change in
the [living status].
"—Yi— yahaaaaaaaaaa!?"

That kind of instinct compelled Steph's melted brain to suddenly move.
In an instant, Steph swiped off Sora's hand, and hit him.
"Whoaa—!"
Sora, who was in a kneeling posture in preparation to flip her skirt, lost his
balance when gently pushed.
Despite trying to avoid the fall, and being barely able to maintain his
standing posture, disaster still ensued.
In order to prevent himself from collapsing, Sora pulled away the distance
and took a few steps back.
—That is when Sora retreated to the door. And after being pushed gently
by Steph, he hit a bump on the wall, then.
—A 'dong' came as a response.
"Ouch!"
Sora with his head aching cried out.
—But it wasn't over yet.
—Alas, what a cheap hotel.
The impact of Sora against the cheap door burst open the hinges, and just
like that, he fell into the corridor.
"..........Nii."
"Eh—eh, wait—"
As if trying to drown out the worried voices of the two people.
'Kaching'——.......the sound of the cheap metal hinges.
—Then a thud.
Because of the reaction of violently opening the door, it quietly swung back
and— closed up.

Part 11
—……

Momentarily, Steph was clueless of what was happening and stood there
motionless.
But because of the fact that Sora had flown into the corridor after being hit
by her...
"—Ah! Sora?"
For the first time, Steph called out the name of that [Man], while standing
up in a panic.
—She had the feeling of her heart being grabbed, while oozing out
uneasiness.
She concluded that due to her actions, she may have caused injury to
others and had a feeling of pure worry.
Not to mention that she may be hated. This kind of anxiety— she decidedly
wouldn't accept it.
Saying this to herself, Steph panicked and rushed out to open the door to
the corridor.
Outside the door, in a corner of the corridor, Sora was trembling while
hugging his head.
"How did—!"
Steph clearly remembered that she didn't use nearly enough strength to
push Sora here.
But the truth was that Sora was indeed in the corner.
"So, Sora!? Are you alright?!"
He was hugging his head to his knees.
It couldn't be due to the head colliding with the door right?—Steph started
to look pale, but—
"Sorry sorry sorry I apologize I apologize so please forgive me!"
—It looked like it was not due to the impact.
Sora only, curled up on the ground and continuously offered an apology.
"—Eh?"

"Sorry sorry I thought I would never have another chance to touch breasts
and I'm a guy after all and I wanted at least one girlfriend I was distracting
myself no I know please don't glare at me like that yes I'm scum yes I'm a
pervert I know sorry sorry sorry!"
—It was clearly that arrogant Sora who had committed that degree of fraud
and sexual harassment.
But now he was trembling just like a new-born lamb, constantly
apologizing.
".......What, what is going on?"
Steph did not understand this situation at all.
Therefore she looked to the sister—Shiro-to ask for an answer, and went
into the room.
".........Nii...Nii.........where.......don't.......leave Shiro...........alone........"
—Sitting on the bed, in an exact state as her brother.
Large round teardrops constantly rolled and curled into drops, and in
addition, kept tumbling down Shiro's trembling yet deadpan expression.
"—Wha, what is going on with them? These siblings."
Forgetting about the groping of her chest, Steph stood there in a daze.
—……
Yes, this is 『

』— Sora and Shiro.

The two-in-one gamer.
This is above being strong or weak in all genres.
But once the two of them are separated— which is to say.
When alone, one becomes an anthrophobic person who can't even
communicate properly with others—
When alone, one becomes an incurable social outcast.
"....Nii.....Nii, where are you....."
"Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry!"

Everyone should understand by now.
One is a NEET.
One is a hikikomori.
These siblings with an age gap of seven could be together only in one
place, their [home]—
This— this is the truth behind the [Urban Legend] of 『

』.

Shiro slightly frowned, while looking at her own chest which was could be
compared to an airport runway[19]

Chapter 2 - Challenger/Challenger
Part 1
Kingdom of Elchea, Capital of Elchea— Western Region, District 3.
After threatening the boss to stay in the Inn, the siblings didn't even last
one night before wordlessly checking out.
However, the second morning had already arrived for the siblings who
were currently lodging in Stephanie Dora's home.
No, to be exact— on the second morning, the siblings had arrived in the
bathroom of her house.
".......Nii.......I hope.....you can explain."
The naked Shiro asked while being shampooed.
"Explain? If it is about the cleaning scene, then there won't be any sort of
development if it isn't a bathing scene, should I explain more?"
"........Nii...........bathing scene.......otherwise..........grade
schoolers.............are, perfect NG's[20]......"
"Don't worry little sister, the infamous [Mist block] will play a role, and make
the scene [Pure]."
Sora gazed at the unnaturally thick mist in the bathroom and said this.
"Could it be, because of this reason, you actually 'boiled up the entire
bath'?"
Steph responded with a dumbfounded expression while washing Shiro's
hair.
"Exactly this reason. This is an important place after all."
"Did you know, because of this, the servants had to needlessly burn that
much firewood?"
And after boiling the bath, it was common sense to not soak into it.
Senselessly wasting all that water to create a mist effect.........

"If you want to say it like that, then what about a particular person who gets
to enjoy such a large bath and still has the audacity to accuse someone of
being wasteful."
"—Guuu...."
(As expected of the lineage of royalty.)
Steph was actually much wealthier than what Sora had imagined.
The house was built with Roman-styled infrastructures, so it would not be
inappropriate to call it a [Castle], much to the chagrin of the siblings who
only knew Japan. Furthermore, the personal bath that Steph had was
spacious enough to fit ten people inside.
The baths, which were also Roman-styled, were currently boiled up to
make the scene [For all ages].
With this level of luxury displayed, people really couldn't help but wonder if
this was really a house from a race that was on the verge of destruction.
"And also, I'm sorry. Because my sister hates to take baths— She also
stubbornly believes that [This includes even if an eleven-year old girl is in
an eighteen-year old's ero book] so she wouldn't let me help her wash,
which explains why she rarely takes a bath. But yesterday she said that if it
was in a clean scene then it was okay, so I thought there was no reason
not to take advantage of that."
"........Guuuu......Nii, hate."
But the bottom line, this rule should be the most applicable to Steph.
Shiro lamented, implying that she was protesting.
"Little sister, if you take care of yourself then you will become super
beautiful, so be a good girl and take a bath."
"......It's fine.....if I'm not a beauty."
"Your brother loves a beautiful Shiro."
"........Guuuuuuuuuuu........"
Muttered Shiro in a low voice. She found it hard to complain more after
hearing Sora say that.

But it will be fine either way.
No, they had attracted unpleasant emotions due their intimate relationship
as siblings, but this fact was ignored.
Compared to that, there was something even more concerning that was at
hand.
(This situation. Why did it happen in the first place.)
(Why am I washing a fully naked Shiro's hair, while Sora is wearing clothes
and standing on the opposite side.)
"—Sora.......why, do I have to wash Shiro's hair?"
—No, it shouldn't be this thorough.
These queries were raised after suffering from a deep remorse on why she
did not reject him before.
"Did you listen to what I said? It's because if you don't do it, Shiro will
refuse to take a bath."
"Do- does it even matter to me?!?"
"Un, you want to let me see?"
"He—hell no! I am just asking if you are intentionally creating more trouble
for me!"
"Rest assured, Steph. I will use my [Additional measures] to appreciate
and feel your naked body later."
"—Wuh!"
Being told off like this, Steph blushed and covered her body.
But on the other hand, hearing the indication that Sora might have interest
in her allowed her a sense of "peace of mind".
Thinking that Sora was looking for a hole in the wall in which he could peek
through, Steph surveyed the room.
"But now, even if included — You can't blindly trust this [Mist block]."
"...........Huh?"

"Just like after my bath, my "little brother" would rise up, or the mist block is
[21]
too insufficient to block off my little sister, then that wouldn't be M18 , but
issued ban." [22]
"—Th-this, ah.."
Steph didn't understand what Sora had just said.
But most importantly, Sora had no reason to peek over.
However, this was the limit of understanding that Steph has, which couldn't
be helped.
What were set in the bathroom were two mobile phones and laptops.
And Steph didn't know that the two tiny holes were cameras.
— After the bath, Shiro would confirm the screen, if there weren't any
problems, they would start watching.
So in Sora's heart, he swore to repress the impulse of wanting to go back
to that world.

Part 2
"Fuu......how comfortable......"
".....Muwuuu........hair slippery........very ticklish...."
While waiting for Shiro to finish, Sora hurriedly took a shower himself.
The seemingly refreshed Sora was in total contrast with Shiro's unhappy
look.
—It appeared that, it was exactly what Sora had mentioned earlier, after
Shiro's white hair was being combed.
Her gently wavy hair, which was as white as snow, was drawn down.
Accompanied by that porcelain-like white skin and coupled with her red
eyes...she was just like a doll produced by a professional craftsmen.
"It would be fine if you'd remain in this state forever. Really, it's such a
waste."
"....Anyways, apart from Nii.......won't show it."

Speaking of which, Sora did also have a hearty appearance after he
shaved his stubble.
How to say it.
(Wh-what a failure.....)
Staring intently at Sora, Steph desperately tried to suppress her
nosebleed, that.....
Currently, Sora did not have the vile feeling that he emitted out during their
first meeting, but instead had the hearty image of a [Good Youth].
However— The problems didn't stem from here.
Trying desperately to endure the forthcoming gushing nose bleed, Steph
blurted out.
"Y-you, both of you— get dressed!"
—Steph got so shocked that she stood up, while the siblings, with only
towels wrapped around themselves, replied.
"......Didn't you say you wanted to wash our clothes? We only have those
clothes to wear...unless they've already been dried?"
Said Sora, who didn't expect that dryers would exist in this world.
"Th-that, that.........then I will prepare you some clothes— male, do we
have male clothes to wear.......gu, guuuuu...................why did it end up like
this.........."
Grumbling, Steph turned around and left to search for clothes.
—10 minutes later.
The exact same location as before, Steph was currently kneeling on the
ground with her head down, deeply regretting what she had done.
(Wh-what a failure.....)
"Ho ho, this is a butler's uniform— the so-called [Tuxedo],
right..........although moving around in it is quite inconvenient, it's quite
interesting, like cosplay! And it matches with the white lining."
Standing in front of the drooping Steph, was a butler-dressed Sora.

"............Fluttering, too much. Inconvenient for movement......."
And Shiro who was wearing Steph's dress from when she was a child.

This was her satisfactory choice after searching for suitable clothes that
would fit both of them.
There was only the servant's clothes for the men— which was the butler's
uniform.
Similarly, for clothes suitable for an eleven year old girl, only the clothes
that she wore in the past could be acceptable.
The gesture of both siblings, were like of a highborn Ojou-sama with her
personal butler beside her.
Steph stole another glance again.
Probably because of his slender body and broad shoulders, the subtle
butler kind of style perfectly matched Sora, which made Steph's heartbeat
pound furiously.
Looking at the little sister who looked like his master, Steph's heart
clenched for the third time.
"Really, a failure...."
"Hmm? What's wrong?"
"Nothing at all!"
Carelessly misspeaking out her inner anxiety, Steph hurriedly shook her
head.
Patting on her knees that were still planted on the ground, Steph stood up.
But if this slender girl's mind could be easily perceived, then Sora did not
resent the eighteen years of being a virgin.
Whispering to himself.
"Slept, refreshed after a bath— Steph."
"Hm, ah, eh? Wh-what is it?"
"What are you panicking for. Erm....this house............this
building........castle?"
For the Tokyo-born Sora, he was unable to classify what Steph's
"residence" type was within his cognitive range, but he concluded that this
was [Just fine].

"Does it have a library or a stack room where books can be accessed and
reviewed?"
"Ah, yes...............there is one..........what are you going to do?"
"Steph, are your ears bad? Didn't I say I want to review the books?"
"Th-that of course I heard it! I am just asking what do you need to check!"
"Check what...........hmmm, naturally about all the things in this world."
"—[This World]?"
Steph was somewhat confused about these words that would normally
come out of inhabitants from a different world.
"......Nii, that.....we haven't told her yet."
Said Shiro with a dejected expression, seeming unwilling to accept her
dried hair.
"—Hmmm? That? Is that so?"
"Erm...I don't understand what you are saying?"
"Ah, how to explain this. This will feel awkward explaining things now."
This kind of topic, whether if it was believed or not, could be said to be the
biggest obstacle.
Sora thought carefully on what he should say in order to gain trust.
—Scratching his head, he sighed.
It was obvious that Sora was showing a troubled expression.
Then, without affectation, he casually said,
"To put it simply, we are [From a different world]. So we want to acquire
knowledge of this world."
—Just like that.

Part 3
They were guided to the library— or what looked like one.

Almost the same proportions as a high school library, it was actually
Steph's [Private stack room].
Huge amounts of books filled the bookshelves that were neatly arranged
against the wall.
Although they wanted to investigate something—
"......Eh, Steph."
"Hmm? What is it?"
Sora unexpectedly ran into a huge obstacle.
"—The common language of this country, it isn't Japanese?"
Holding the book that was in a foreign language, Sora hugged his head
and groaned.
"Japanese? I don't quite understand, but the natural lingua franca for the
human species is [Human language]."
"Whoa............a really super, straightforward world."
Obviously there wasn't a problem with communicating.
Yet the text written in the book could not be identified.
".........Then, are you guys really from a different world?"
"Yeah, I know you'll find it hard to believe—"
People wouldn't believe Sora's words, but rather think that it was a plot in a
story. Even Sora didn't expect to be trusted easily.
"Ah, no. On that point, I have never doubted it."
Hearing Steph's soft reply, Sora could not help but be stunned.
"Huh? Why?"
In return, the conversely shocked Steph also replied.
"You ask me why.......the Elves who possess high level magic were
originally summoned from another world, so this is not an eye-catching
thing. Moreover, looking at your appearance, it was certain that you were
not people of this country, but you could only be human........"

—After all, there was only one country left for mankind.
"Ahhh.......that's right~. This is a fantasy world after all~.......Fuu."
Seeming to be too paranoid, Sora sighed deeply.
Once again, he flipped through the foreign book and scratched his head.
"Hmmm........it is indeed troublesome to not be able to rely on our general
knowledge. Can you remember it...........Shiro?"
"........Un."
"How?"
".....Un."
Sora and Shiro.
They seemed to be exchanging information with a communication method
known only to the siblings.
Casting their line of sight on the books, both of them fell silent.
Unable to stand this awkwardness, Steph sighed.
"......So, what should I do?"
This time, she would probably have to [Contribute] and be a tutor for both
of them, which could not help but add a little self-deprecating flavor.
But, Sora who had moved his sight away from the book, proposed
something different.
"No. What I want is something different."
Hearing that, Steph suddenly remembered what had happened last night
and this morning, before assuming a defensive posture.
Even though Steph would not be surprised if she heard dozens of
Perverted-H things coming from his mouth—
"Could you answer a few questions for me."
"— Okay.......ah, huh? That, no problem."
Hearing something unexpected yet serious, Steph stroked her chest in
relief.

Putting on a serious face, Sora continued.
"Yesterday, when I groped your chest, you had no resistance, so why did
you hit me when I tried to flip your skirt, just why— okay, okay, I'll be
serious, that was just a joke........."
Feeling the penetrating gaze of Steph, Sora's gaze once again fell back
onto the book.
"Hmm, I often hear the words 'Human race', so what are the other 'Races',
then."
Looking like she had heard an incredible question, Steph rejoined.
"...........Is there only the human race in Sora's world?"
"Well, at least the only form of interaction we have should only be with that
of a [Human]— so?"
"Ah, guu.......this, eh...."
As they had claimed, they were not from this world, so what should be
clarified first. After considering this point, Steph began talking.
"Firstly— do you know about [God's words]?"
"How the [Ten Oaths] came into being? We heard it from some choir group
by the fountain not too long ago."
"I understand...— then— "
—Cough cough.
"The so-called [Races], for which the [Ten Oaths] were laid down for, are
the intellectual 【Sixteen Races】."
"Sixteen races......"
"With the [Ten Oatha] as the basis, the rights to encroach, violate, destroy,
and mutually kill for the 【Sixteen Races】— were all taken away, and the
result was, war disappeared from this world."
"......I see. And I was originally wondering where would the food come from
— but it turned out that the [Oaths] were only limited to intellectual life."
While flipping through the book, Sora felt quite satisfied with what he had
said.

Seeing this, Steph sighed and muttered 'How smart' in her heart, before
continuing.
"However, let's see, using games to determine ongoing wars. Which are
also territorial battles— 'Gambling for the country'. Even as we speak,
someone would most likely be playing this sort of game."
[Gambling for the country]— Sora had some reaction to this previously
heard phrase.
"—The human race's country is only left with Elchea, right?"
".........Currently, it is indeed true...........even though it was not said that
other races would have only one country— but for the human race, we are
only left with Elchea."
— Even till here.
Sora kept asking questions which he had already known the answers to.
And comparing with this world, their own world seemed to have more
common sense.
Which means,
"So if there is no war, why fight for territory? Can't interlocution solve
anything?"
".....Guu, that....."
But, Shiro replied instead of the halted Steph.
"...........Resources are limited...........as long as continuous propagation is
infinite........sharing will also be limited...............leading to common
demise."
"Y-yeah. Just like that!"
Hearing the opinions of Shiro who had snatched her chance to speak,
Steph hurriedly nodded.
"........You...didn't even consider that before, right......."
Because Shiro answered first, Sora, who did not receive the perception a
resident this world might have, helplessly watched Steph.
"Wh-wh-what are you saying, this type of thing!"

—Indeed, she did perceive all of this as "common sense", since she was
born here after all.
So as for why the games were used to compete for this problem, it was
going to be difficult to answer when questioned.
".......In any case, this problem is quite similar to our world's too."
Sora sighed.
Even without [War], [Competition] still exists.
—Which also means, [Total equality] is unachievable.
If equality was equal to handing out limited chairs, then competing with
each other would be a game of [Musical Chairs].
And the results, the wealthy would be the [Minority] while the poor would
be the [Majority]—
What a pain, there was clearly nothing different between this world and
their world.......
"Then, what kind of specific races are there in the 【Sixteen Races】?"
Pausing all his thoughts, Sora got the topic back on track.
Steph hummed........like she was desperately trying to recall things, while
counting numbers using her fingers.
"Below only God, the first is the Divine Spirit race, then the second is the
Phantasma race, number three is the Elementals race— there is also the
Dragon and Giant race...........Elf and Werebeast race, erm— and so on."
"........Hmmmm, as expected of a benevolent fantasy world."
Steph seemed to have given up on reciting the sixteen races after reaching
the middle.
Facing against the weak-minded Steph, Sora suddenly remembered
another question.
"Hey, what are the [Number placings].........for?"
"Uh, that. I am not so sure myself, but it seemed to be some sort of ranking
sequence."

"— Ranking sequence?"
"Un, un, to say it simply, the level of their adaptive magic, which was what I
heard."
"What do you mean, what I heard...you are really ambiguous. Steph, did
you receive education?"
Disregarding his NEET identity, Sora asked to a seemingly unhappy Steph.
All the things he said, lead to a new topic, before coughing afterwards.
"First things first, I did~ I did graduate from college, okay?! And about this
ranking sequence, there was nothing to research about humans—
because we are number 16— which means that our magic adaptive level is
0. It couldn't be observed no matter how hard you research about it."
".......0?"
Sora shifted his line of sight away from the book and asked.
"Hmm—? Wait, humans can't use magic?"
"Yeah. Apart from that, we can't even perceive magic."
".............I feel like.............as long as you use props, wouldn't that do?"
"Games infused with magic could be played..........because the game itself
require magic to be driven— but magic for mankind is just impossible."
"—Absolutely?"
Although Sora kept firing annoying questions, Steph didn't show any sighs
of boredom. Actually, it would be better to say—
"Absolutely. Humans can't connect to the [Spirit Corridor]— which is the
source of magic."
Steph slightly lowered her head.
"That's why we are on a losing streak for [Gambling for the Country]......"
—Aaa.
With a slightly bitter smile, Sora went on.

".......Then, the most adept at using magic are? It really is the number one
right?"
"Ah, no. Being closer to number one, means being closer to becoming
gods— their existence could be regarded as a form of magic. But
generally, for the most adept in using magic, it would be the [Elf race] from
number seven."
Elf. A typical impression crossed Sora's mind after hearing the word.
"—Elf........isn't an Elf...pointy eared, pale skin?"
Steph gave out an expression that clearly wondered how did residents
from another world know so much.
"Errr, yes. Now, the largest country in this world would be [Aylwin Gerudo],
a place that is driven by magic. But upon mentioning magic, the word could
be synonymous with the Elf race."
—Sora sighed with a 'Fuu'.
Placing his hand on his chin, Sora used a very serious expression and
started thinking.
"—"
Because Sora was decked out in a tuxedo uniform, in addition to his
serious face, Steph's heart started beating wildly.
(Illusion, illusion, illusion— these are only instilled feelings.)
Just when Steph's heart went into meditation, Sora seemed to have
finished his thoughts.
As if wondering about something, Sora carefully worded his reply.
"...........A race that can't use magic..........can't have a [Big country]?"
"Eh, ah, no, the Werebeast race from number 14 can't use magic
either....."
Steph reluctantly and incoherently answered.
"But, what's different is, they can rely on their powerful senses to read the
magic atmosphere and people's feelings. The islands in the South-Eastern

seas are joined together as the Werebeasts' country, the [Eastern Union],
which is the world's third largest country—"
Steph painfully, and unconsciously increased the strength of her hand that
was clutching her arm, before continuing.
".......Even if they can't use magic, they can still compete with others— with
the exception of [Aylwin Gerudo], they can rival many races and nations.
But no matter, in a human's eyes, it would seem that they were using
something similar to [Super powers] or [Super sensing]."
"—Aaaa. So that's how it is."
If humans can't even detect the usage of magic, wielding it would be
impossible.
A unilateral disadvantage where the opponent uses cheats that can't be
detected, of course humans can't win.
—If this was confirmed, then losing was natural.
"Hmmmmmm, there is such a thing, eh."
As if Sora had figured it out, he nodded strongly. But at the same time.
"......Nii—I memorized it."
Shiro's voice sounded.
"Oh, as expected of my little sister."
"..........Continue, praising me."
"Ohh, of course. As expected of my prided sister, so talented! Very
awesome."
Sora stood up and casually stroked Shiro's head, for which Shiro
responded by narrowing her eyes like a cat.
Steph did not understand what was going on and just stared at them,
before muttering.
".....Eh? Memorized what?"
"What are you asking about, of course the human language."
Shifting his sight to the amazed Steph, Sora casually said.

"But she really is incredible, eh. I still need a bit more time."
"......Nii, how slow.........."
"..........Huhuhu, for a man, compared to fast, slower is better right?"
"............Nii, how small."
"It, it's, it's, its not small!! On, on what basis—— Steph, are you okay?"
Steph was stunned just by listening to their conversation.
With her tone changed, she said.
"That......I didn't hear wrongly right? Did you all just— memorized a
language?"
"Well, yeah? So what?"
".......(Nods)."
"—In such a short time? Are you kidding me?"
Her face slightly twitched again to confirm it. But Sora breezily replied.
"This is nothing surprising. Since grammar and words are similar to
dialogues, won't memorizing the text settle everything."
"........Nii........that, you haven't memorized it yet."
"Finishing it in 10 minutes is too fast for your brother. Your brother isn't as
smart as you, I will probably still need one more hour. Oh yeah, how to
read this by the way. I can't seem to grasp the marking law—"
".......That, isn't........Japanese............use Latin grammar, to read it.........."
"No, I've thought about that already, but the syntax for the position of the
predicate is quite strange."
"...........Ancient Chinese............."
"Eh? So only the depiction part is in front! How annoying— ah, but now the
sentence is smooth."
"...........Nii, needs to master, more languages......"

"For you to learn eighteen different languages, it is already a special case.
And as for me, I am just a people person, six languages is already enough
for me to play games without encountering any difficulties."
—Steph implausibly listened to the siblings conversation.
But the siblings only had a casual look.
Both of them seemed to be taking her for granted, casually talking to each
other.
Language, also could communicate. As long as the text is memorized.
Arranging that sentence, it actually did indeed sound quite simple.
However, they didn't enumerate another important fact into their conscious
yet.
Which was—
[No one to teach], which also meant that what they did was not『Study』,
but『Interpret』.
Completing such a thing in a short time, yet they did not seem boastful.
(In, In their world— is this counted as normal?)
Both of them had already exceeded her comprehension of creatures.
Looking at the siblings that were not from this world, Steph felt a chill down
her spine.
However, at the same time, faint warmth started pouring out of her chest.
......Unless this is.
Unless she herself.
Are meeting people that had transcended humans.
And they are the ones— which will eventually change the people of this
country.
"— Hm? What's wrong?"
Aware of being stared at, Sora turned his head to face Steph, which
heated up her inner agitation even more.

"Eh, ah, no, that— I will, go make tea."
Steph hurriedly left the library in a panic, with her ears dyed red.
Puzzledly watching Steph left, Sora said.
".......What's wrong with her?"
But Shiro did not even give a glance at him and just continued reading the
book.
"......Nii, absolutely......don't know........a maiden's heart."
"— If I understood that, I would not have kept my virginity for 18 years
already. And what does a maiden's heart have to do with that?"
A scene where an eleven year old girl preaching to an eighteen year old
about a maiden's heart.
Although men mature later than women..........
At least for this occasion, this saying was applicable.
".......Obviously, compared to Shiro..........better, at reading others
feelings........"
Shiro whispered, and that boast made Sora look triumphant.
"In games, this would reflect my ability, but in reality, reading a person's
mood is a completely different thing."
That analogy to compare games and the so-called female— No, "so-called
human".....
Just like a galge, where tens of thousands of time-limited options would
jump out every second.
Facing that kind of impossible game that generate their own ideas was of
course not natural.
—But, the matter does not matter right now.
"Okay......"
Under Shiro's help, Sora finally was finally able to understand the human
language

He read an entire book to confirm his results.
After closing the hardcover book with a 'Pata!'
A serious face began showing.
"Okay— Shiro."
".......Un."
"You are aware of it already right."
"......Un."
The siblings were communicating in a language that only both of them
understood.
Sora, unconfidently and with little insight, asked.
"— What do you think?"
But Shiro closed her eyes and replied.
"........Shiro—Will follow.....Nii."
Slightly opening her eyes, and showing the usual deadpan, Shiro
dismissively said.
".......Just like that promise—no matter, where."
—Promise, yes.
Father brought a [Little sister] from the previous marriage—Shiro.
The amazing little sister who was a born talent.
And a brother whose innate mind was horrible.
Because of the erraticness, both of them complemented each other better
than real siblings.
Eventually, even both parents abandoned them.
Without any friends nor companions, a promise was forged between them.
—Because of being too capable, the little sister was misunderstood by
others.

—Because of being too incapable, the brother was good at reading others.
To make up for the shortcomings, the ten year old [Brother] from then
made an proposal.
And the three year old [Little sister] that was capable of multiple
languages, nodded and pinky swore.
Stroking the head of his [Little sister].
Since then, for eight years—
The little sister who would follow her shameless brother— Shiro.
However, a brother who did not even take her out of the room— Sora.
If it wasn't a regret, then it was.....
"In short— compared to [That world], this side is much more interesting
right?"
He stared at the distant horizon where a chessboard was faintly visible.
Taking out his phone, Sora started the schedule planner.

Part 4
Steph watched as the boiling water sounded with a 'Gulou Gulou'.
Needless to say, when boiling tea leaves, the temperature for the water is
extremely important.
Accompanying the tea were pancakes made yesterday.
It had been too long since the human territory last had sugar, so snacks
were thoroughly lacking.
She could only use cinnamon as a replacement for sugar for the pancakes,
which she made, full of confidence.
—The tea, with the sliced pancakes, were placed on the tray.
"......Okay, there should be no more problems."
Feeling a sense of accomplishment, Steph gently wiped the sweat off of
her forehead for a job well done.

"Erm, Ojou-sama."
As if waiting for the chance to approach her, the maids asked Steph.
"Ah, what is it?"
"No.....sorry for our rudeness, but Ojou-sama, what are you doing?"
".........Indeed, you are very rude. Why the sudden question?"
"No, that........if you had just commanded us, we, the maids, would have
prepared the tea and snacks, but you wordlessly did it on your
own.................and you seem to be desperately trying to do it well......."
——……………….
A-re?
Hearing that, she wondered: why did she make the tea with her own
hands?
Raising such a question for herself, a scenario started appearing in her
head.
[Whoa. How delicious. Steph, you're really good at housework, aren't you.]
Just like that, Sora would hold the teacup in one hand and smile.
——…………Puu, dee.
Blood started filling Steph's face.
"——AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, what the helllllllllllllll!!"
Shouting this, Steph headbutted the wall.
"Why do I have to personally make snacks to prove my own housework
prowess! That man, it would've been enough to just give him that water
over there— and that rock, plus the weeds!"
"Oj-Ojou-sama! Please calm down!"
"Chi-chief maid! Oj-Ojou-sama's mentality is unstable—!"
The maid hurriedly stopped Steph from producing more of the 'bang bang
bang' sounds, falling into a state of chaos.

Part 5
"........Ah~......"
Sighing sadly, Steph walked in the hallway while carrying a silver tray.
On the tray, there were 2 portions— which was the tea and refreshments
that were prepared for the siblings earlier.
Once again failing to overcome her feelings, Steph personally prepared the
items meant for them while sighing again.
Self-loathing, but at the same time, the thought of seeing Sora enjoying the
food and praising her—
".............Can't deny that I am a little bit expectant.........heh."
However.
Steph suddenly stopped moving.
"Wait a moment, Steph. This food, will it suit the taste of someone from a
different world?"
Steph was confident with her tea and cooking techniques.
But, the receivers were not from this world.
"Ah—darn it—"
Another scenario swept past her mind.
『Whoa, sorry, but I'll pass on this one』
Sora blubbled with a wrinkly face.
"Ahhhhhhhhh.......is, isn't that bad, the retreat route of saying『this was
made by the maids』had disappeared already— erm, what kind of retreat
route is that! No matter what they think, I don't really care— no! Ahhhhhhh
Really..............this, is definitely a curse......"
Getting completely caught in a state of confusion and helplessness.
Taking a deep breath, she started organizing her thoughts to search out an
excuse.

"Ye-yes. Not only taken in as a fool, if I can't even make one cup, or one
piece of snack, this would tarnish the Dora's family reputation. But this is
unquestionable tasty, it must be the cultural difference if it was disliked—
yeah, this excuse— this"
Chattering everything out.
While reciting out the excuse, both hands that were in an empty state,
struggled to open the stack room's door.
"—A-re?"
—Surveying everywhere, the figure of the siblings weren't there.
Wind that came from an unlocked balcony door near the front stairs blew
against the curtain slightly.
Arriving to the balcony.......Steph found the siblings there.
The butler-dressed brother was currently leaning on the balcony, taking a
picture of the street with his phone.
The little sister that was a reminiscent of a white-haired Ojou-sama—
leaned against her brother while reading a book.
—The duo that was always together, wouldn't surprise anyone if they died
due to separation.
Seeing the pair in a picturesque scene— and their relationship.
Her heart started to clench, but Steph reminded herself that it was just a
misconception.
".......What a bustling street."
Watching the commotion outside, Sora said.
"—Yeah. The selection for the king's position is still ongoing."
Replying, Steph placed the tray on the table that was on the balcony, and
started pouring the tea.
".......That.......please enjoy."
"Ah, thanks."
"Little sister should drink one too."

".......Un."
The initial impression—was a city of a『Typical fantasy world』— but now
it was slightly different.
— Due to the prohibition of war, the city was not damaged in any way.
The various buildings that resembled Romanesque architecture, classical
architecture and Baroque architecture were intertwined.
The road was paved with bricks, a wagon was walking up link, and a
barque was docked on the harbor not far away.
It looked like even the steam engines had not been invented.
Even more distant away, was a range of terraced hills, with the agricultural
practices using a style that was more ancient than this city.
—If war did not happen, this scene would be the perfect reflection of it.
Ironically, 『Chemistry』was accelerated during the war, so that fertilizer
and fuel was dependent of technology to significantly leap forward.
Then again, the books seen in Steph's library were almost entirely written
by hand— manuscripts.
Probably typography wasn't invented yet or it was still not popularized.
"Renaissance of the Medieval Europe. Or probably before being
contaminated by the industrial revolution.............what a beautiful city."
".............Copied references...........from strategy game..............you worked
hard."
—But, Sora thought.
According to God's words, the great war where the celestial body turned
this into a scorched earth, was probably thousand of years ago.
That is to say, since the conclusion of the『Oaths』, it had been a few
thousand years already.
And [Human kind] who was incapable of using any magic.
The same constitution as the [Human] in their original world.

After thousand of years, their world level was still stuck in the early fifteenth
century.
—How about those racial civilization that could use magic to cheat, what
was their situation.
Sora suddenly asked.
"Ne, Steph—you, why do you want to be the King?"
"—Ah?"
"I heard that its because you will no longer be royalty, and that you were
desperately trying to disprove this rumor."
Sora recalled back what he heard in the Inn cum Tavern. But.
"—That, it doesn't matter anymore."
—In the final analysis, rumors are rumors. One laugh and it would be over.
She stood next to Sora and overlooked the street view.
"—This country— Elchea, is considered pretty big right?"
Looking into the distance— past the normal line of sight, she continued.
"In the past, the world had several human countries. And Elchea was
considered it's largest."
Prideful, yet self-depreciative, she continued.
"But since the introduction of the『Ten Oath』, this had become the
sole『Last country』for mankind already."
"......."
"It looks very lively right? But............Elchea is moving towards the path of
destruction."
Once again looking at the hustle and bustle of the street, but this time her
expression was depressing.
Following the line of sight, Sora easily imagined it out.
Losing territory, a small country with a huge population.
Lack of resources and food would eventually lead to economic stagnation.

Wanting to produce food, yet no land to do so, and with no outputs, there
would be no labor positions.
Although the order made by the『Ten Oath』was stable,
—He thought of the time when he arrived in this world, ganged up by a
group a thieves.
Sora gazed towards the direction of the cliff.
Shiro who was leaning on her brother's leg and reading a book, browsed
towards Steph.
"The previous king— my Ojii-san, lost the gambling for country, forcing him
into an impasse, which was the capital. With the humans on a losing
streak, the situation would keep deteriorating....."
Clenching her fist, Steph bit down on her lip.
"Accused of being stupid, yet still thinking of saving the country, wasn't
wrong in anyway—"
—If land was not taken back, humans won't be able to multiply indefinitely.
Rather than waiting for its demise, it was better to find a way out from this
poor environment—was it.
"I—want to save Elchea...."
Steph was trying to fight back her tears.
"Prove to everyone that Ojii-san wasn't wrong—the continuation of the
human kind..........actively take the offensive to recapture territories,
otherwise in the near future, humans will really be extinct."
—This sentence came out painfully from Steph.
With her usual expression, Shiro indifferently asked.
"……Steph.....like.........this country, this world?"
"Un un—of course!"
—Smiling with tears.
Steph promptly answered.

However, in contrast with her actions, both siblings lowered their heads.
".........How great, ah......."
"..........Yeah, it really is enviable that one could assert it out."
But—Sora used a calm, yet indefensible tone of voice.
And Shattered the glimmer of hope that Stephanie Dora had.
"But that sort of wish cannot be accomplished."
"—Wuh...."
"And, to say something worse—"
He got close to the speechless Steph and attacked(Verbally).
"Your grandfather—right here right now, I will say he is the worst foolish
king."
—…………
Looking like she was trying hard to squeeze out words, Steph opened her
mouth after the long silence.
"—Wh-Why.......would you think so?"
Biting her lips, the feeling of nails digging into the flesh of her palm could
be felt.
.......If violence wasn't prohibited in this world, those words would have
rewarded a slap across Sora's face. Even so, Steph was still fuming mad
and angrily remarked.
Obsessed with him—no.
No matter how strong the mandatory of falling in love is, she could not
forgive such verbal abuse.
But for this question, Sora sighed and took a photograph using his phone.
Reminiscent of the European city from the fifteenth century.
No reasons to go to war, the old and new buildings mixed together,
showing a beautiful city.
However, precisely because of this—remorse could be felt.

"If this goes on—this country will perish. At the same time the selection of
the new King is going on."
The unexpected phrase came out.
Using a hysterical tone, the confused Steph retorted.
"Wh-Why would you say that! Precisely because this wasn't supposed to
happen, the selection of King was created."
The somewhat helpless Sora and Shiro lifted their heads to look at the sky.
A different shade of grey from what they were familiar with, like the color of
a spilled blue ink, a generally blue sky.
—Then, both of them thought of the things when they had just arrived.
The words that "God" said to them.
All decisions decided with a simple game, the world similar to a
chessboard, [Dischord].
My—
Shiro's—
—A dream world
—New lease of life—world.
".......Steph, when will this gambling assembly end?"
Although Steph did not accept the words said previously and looked
unhappy, she still replied.
"—Today is the last day."
Setting her line of sight on the eastern side, what looked to be a King's city.
"In the evening, the last game will be played in the hall, if there was no
person who raised objections to the final victory, then the victor will be the
new king.........is there any problem?"
Closing the book with a 'Pata', Shiro stood up.
Stretching his waist, Sora patted his cheeks.
"—Yosh! Eh, little sister."

"......Un."
"No matter what your brother does, will you follow?"
"Un."
"Instantaneous reply eh. And I was prepared for some struggling to—"
".......Liar."
"Hm?"
"......Nii, looks........very happy."
As expressionless as usual.
A smile could be seen through the sights of Sora.
"—Haha, busted by you right?"
Ending it, both of them turned and went.
"Hey, wait, where are you going!?"
"King City."
"—Aa?"
Seemingly not being able grasp what Sora had said, Steph sent out a silly
voice.
However, not minding that, Sora continued walking.
"I am going to prove that your grandpa was right."
"——Aa?"
Sensing that Steph was hastening from behind.
Sora confirmed the matters in his phone's schedule planner.
—『Target』—In any case, become the King first.
Showing a wry smile, Sora pocketed his phone.
"Rarely obtaining a new world, it would be troublesome to come to a place
where it keeps losing."
"............(Nods)(Nods)."

"Then let's go be a king, and snatch back the territories."
—Was that misheard?
Stephanie Dora tried to carefully confirm what was said earlier.
Then, when it was confirmed that she had not misheard, she looked at the
man's back.
A relaxed tone as if going out to buy something.
But wanting to confirm a piece of matter, the rebellious self-confidence and
a sense of trust—
The man's back that declared that he was going to recapture the territory
of humanity.
"Ah, right."
Grabbing the snack from the balcony table, Sora stuffed it into his mouth.
"—Ah"
Facing towards Steph who had forgotten that the snack was even there,
"Un, delicious. The refreshments, were all delicious. Thank you!"
Turning his head around, he smiled towards himself.
Her heartbeat increasing violently, was it because of the [Oath]?
Even Steph was not sure of that now.

Chapter 3: - Expert/Expert
Part 1
Evening— King City, Elchea. The hall.
At the time when the majority of the crowd had already believed that the
selection of the king was coming to a conclusion.
In front of the throne, a small table and two chairs facing opposite sides
around it were placed.
The spectators that packed the hall focused their attention on one of the
seated people.
—Leaning against the table, expressionlessly crossing her arms, wearing a
black veil draped over her head, resembling a mourning shawl, exuding an
aura as if she was dead, was a tall black haired girl—
Yes........the one who cheated to eliminate Steph— that girl.
An old man whose appearance matched that of a high ranking official said.
"—Then, this person— Kurami Zierh remains victorious in the
election...........are there any other challengers?"
Although there was lots of noise and clattering in the hall, evidently there
was no one with the look of a challenger.
That was normal— a girl who had won all the games so far— Kurami.
By now, those who believed that someone could still defeat her didn't exist
anymore.
Kurami closed her eyes to this fact, and added a non-emotional feeling to
her original deadpan expression.
Since it was like this, the old man added.
"—Then, complying with the previous king's last words, Kurami-sama— will
become the new king of Elchea. If you have any objections, please stand
up. Otherwise, remain silent—"
"Ah, yes, yes. I disagree. I disagree, I disagree~!"

The phrase resounded throughout the hall, interrupting the old man. The
black-haired girl— Kurami, opened her eyes.
All eyes in the noisy hall converged at the direction from which the sound
came from.
A butler, along with a white-haired girl— Sora and Shiro, stood up and
raised their hands.
"Yes, yes. I have an objection, we both have an objection."
".......Un."
"........Who's that?"
With her blank expression, Kurami's line of sight fell behind the two people.
"—Stephanie Dora's..........servants?"
Standing behind those two was Stephanie, whose shoulders were shaking.
Still devoid of expression, yet with a slightly mocking tone, she said.
"—Because you lost to me and couldn't be eligible for the election, you
sent servants? It's really a shameful act, isn't it........."
However, towards Kurami who sent an undisguised look of contempt.
Sora only smiled and replied while walking to her.
"Ahahaha, that sentence, you're not in any position to say that."
"—What do you mean, eh."
"Aiyah, but in fact, I don't really give a damn for this troublesome selection
for the king's throne, it's not my cup of tea oh."
Sora scratched his head, saying the same things that could be known as
annoying. Kurami narrowed her eyes.
"..........In that case, can you please disappear? This is not a place where
you can play around with children."
Sora started laughing— with a "But ah", his narrowed his eyes.
"It's not good to give a vacated throne to someone who『is a cheater that
borrows strength from other countries』right?"

The city interior started stirring up due to this sentence.
— Strength from other countries? — what is that? However, those
chattering were filtered out.
With sound audible only to Shiro, Sora whispered.
"—Is it there?"
What was on Shiro's hand, was the phone Sora used to shoot yesterday at
the bar.
Identifying the photo displayed on the screen, there were people who were
recognizable in this hall.
".........Four persons"
Shiro answered.
"Aside from that— the guy who hid his ears?"
"One person."
"Bingo. Then point her out with this current opportunity."
".......Un."
Steph leaned forward and asked to the siblings who were currently
discussing.
"Hey.............this, what is going on? What thing about his country's
strength?"
Steph quietly whispered in Sora's ear, and Sora replied to her clueless
expression,
"You still don't get it? Well, for example? For example—"
It turned loud.
"Conspiring with elves, using magic to achieve total victory to become the
next king, and finishing this country once and for all!"
Fear started to mingle with the commotion in the hall.
Gazing at this scene, Sora confirmed that no one had really noticed this
truth.

"...............But then, if such a major problem wasn't even noticed, perhaps
the defeat of the human species is a natural outcome."
"—Ne, you."
Kurami stood up while saying and walked towards Sora.
The expressionless face that was concealed by the veil exuded out a
unique sense of coercion.
"Are you trying to say that, I used magic to cheat?"
"Don't be like that, didn't I say『For example』? Or did I really hit the
mark?"
However, that sense of coercion wasn't even acknowledged in the
slightest.
Sora carefreely ignored that kind of pressure, and still carried a very
blatant provocation. This should be based on what he has absolute
confidence in.
"—Okay. Since you have a disagreement, I'll take it as you want to play a
game now?"
"Fineeee~. It's a great help for you to do that~♪ But—"
Then, Sora interrupted Kurami who was just about preparing the poker
cards.
"Since it is a poker game— wouldn't it be better if you could dismiss those
facilitators over there right?"
Afterwards, as if responding to Sora's smile, Shiro stretched her fingers.
The commotion suddenly calmed down, and the attention of the crowd
became concentrated on the direction of that finger.
Kurami— and the man pointed, started twitching in their faces.
That small and relative change— was easily seen as a sufficient lethal
point.
"— What are you talking about eh?"
"Ah, really? Then, could someone take down that person's hat?"

Even though the accused man took a step back, the surrounding audience
eventually removed his hat.
Two ears were exposed.
—Often seen in fantasy stories— yes, the long ears of elves.
Is, Isn't that guy from the elf race?
Chatter chatter.
Hey hey........then, it really was exactly what that guy said—
Chatter chatter.
That bitch, used magic-oriented cheats?
"Aye aye, this glamorous and beautiful fraud master, can you go and assist
your friend?"
Ridiculed by Sora, Kurami's expression remain undaunted.
"—Don't let me reiterate again and again, I don't understand what are you
trying to say."
"Ah~really.Then throwing him out would create no problems right?"
Grinning, Sora waved his hands with a 'Hush hush' as if trying to drive out
that elf-like man.
After that, he turned to face Kurami again, and retrieved out another one—
Shiro's phone.
"Okay, then we should start playing the poker now right, no problems
right?"
While using the cellphone to use, Sora laughed and said.
—A few seconds of silence
Kurami with her usual deadpan, shut her eyes and said.
"—I see, you are thinking that I'm having a collusion with that elf who god
knows came from where, pushing me into some kind of standpoint alike of
an [Enemy of humanity] who made use of magic............is that right?"
"Ah, a splendid rhetorical question. Or, you are prepared already?"

Kurami, upon hearing the further provocation from Sora,
"—However, I also have dignity here."
Remaining in her unreadable expressionless face, she cast a sight from
beneath her veil, as if to penetrate through Sora.
"If you wish, you may chase off that elf to wherever you like. Then— we
won't let any cheat to intervene, and demonstrate our true strength by
deciding a showdown using games."
But that proposal was exactly what Sora had envisioned, so he smiled
frivolously and said.
"Well~ Article 5 of 『Ten Oaths』, the challenged party has the right to
decide the contents of the game—however, why do you have to give up on
poker this time, and I'm being really gentle for not getting to the bottom of
that♥"
Saying that, he aimed the phone's camera at Kurami, taking a picture with
a 'Kacha'
"Hmm, you really aren't photogenic ah? It would be more lovely if you
could smile a little."
Finishing, Sora showed the display screen to Kurami.
What he got back was a glare filled with killing intent, but Sora merely
made eye contact at her without faltering
—An observant eye that could see through anything
Kurami, felt faint chills circulating in her body—.

Part 2
Kurami suggested the most suitable game to be brought from her house
that could demonstrate one's true strength.
She simply said "Please wait a moment", before abruptly leaving King city.
On the other hand, Sora and the others were in the castle's atrium, waiting
while being bathed in sunset.
Sitting on a bench, both Sora and Shiro fiddled with their phones while
awaiting.

Glancing around from time to time.
Confirming that there was no one in the vicinity, Steph excitedly inquired
Sora.
"—The, then, I, I was being cheated with magic right!?"
.......Your, voice, too loud."
Steph was carrying a did not understand kind of expression.
—But, she finally understood the truth behind the cheat that defeated her.
Moreover, the cheat had some involvement with magic, so towards this
point, it was comprehensible to her.
However, Sora who was considering something else, replied absently.
"Yeah, yes.......but to be more accurate, it was the magic used by a third
person who was the elf."
"Wha- what kind of magic was it?"
In the end, what kind of magic was used,
In addition, the only human who saw through that facade was Sora.
Moreover, the two were constantly concerned about the tools they were
manipulating.
Tools from a different world— maybe it could detect the usage of magic?
Waiting for the answer with expectant eyes, the reply Sora gave to Steph
was.
"Who knows? I have absolutely no clue."
—This answer that completely did not live up to her expectations.
Ignoring the dismayed and silent Steph, Sora dismissively replied.
"This was indeed a clever cheat. Back in the pub, I noticed that during the
battle with that guy, the hand that she collected was just too obvious. Shiro
and I immediately spotted that out."
"......Was Shiro, who noticed that."

"What a fussy little sister eh...........but it doesn't matter."
—Yesterday, on the first floor of the hotel/tavern.
Outside the tavern, in the midst of the poker game between Steph and
Kurami.
Coincidentally playing poker too, similarly using cheat, Sora was convinced
of his assertions towards the game inside.
However—
"If you want to ask me how that happened, I certainly have no reason to
know. After all, I know nothing about things related to magic."
"........"
Listening to the casual remark from Sora, Steph's half-opened mouth was
frozen.
"Ahh, magic is really powerful eh. If『Memory tampering』or『Rewriting
the fold』can't be proven, then winning is impossible. If humans can't
perceive magic, then they can only be aware of it when it comes down to
their gut feeling."
"—Wait"
Resurrecting from the petrochemical state, Steph shook her head and
asked.
"Wait a moment, then how are we going to win!"
"Huh? It's impossible to win."
Facing Sora who would rather assert, Steph became speechless once
again.
"It will be weird if you could win when dueling with those kind of opponents.
The words are merely『Doomed to failure』— doesn't even have a
chance to win in one in a million."
But, Steph recovered again and started shouting, with Sora adding more
words in.
"So that's why we have to avoid it."
"—Eh?"

Steering his body to face Steph, Sora continued.
"Listen carefully, I am going to describe it as simple as possible."
"Guuu, okay...."
"Firstly, regarding this take turns in fighting one opponent to tire him out
kind of king election, the winner will be the representative of the human
species."
"Yeah....."
"But this kind of proposal is flawed. Because there will be lots of leeway for
other countries."
"—Guu. Indeed that's the case ....."
Being pointed something that Steph didn't even realise, she unwillingly set
her gaze away.
—Yes. Using unconditional method like 'take turns in fighting one opponent
to tire him out' to determine the electoral law.
If other countries help humans who can't sense magic to win, a puppetry
government would be completed.
Humans would completely lose and eventually perish.
Full of loopholes, a folly solution.
"—Which also means this is not an individual battle. But a nation,
diplomatic war. OK?"
"Ah, so it's like that.......I get it."
"So, it is the elf......right? Although those group of guys want a human
puppet to be elected as king— but able to think so complicatedly to this
degree, you don't think that the elves are the only species involved right?"
"—Th-that...."
"The other countries are considering the same thing, whether the first
implementation has been taken in account, we won't know, but it is a very
high probability."
Then—

"We will from this point onwards, change their mindset, making them think
that we are [Also the same as humans]."
Playing with his cellphone, Sora let out a mischievous smile.
"Owning equipment that humans can't possibly have, looking as if the
device was used to detect the magic, naturally the person will be instantly
disqualified if magic was debunked. Furthermore, the key performer has
already been suspected and driven out—"
"The, then— suggested a battle under no influence of cheating right!"
A smiling face started appearing on Steph, but Sora only furrowed his
brows, before drooping his shoulders and saying.
"—You ah, to what degree is your naivety."
"Wh, why am I suddenly lectured!?'
"Did you hear what I said? Involvement from other countries, is within their
expected range. Which is to say, they would naturally put into account the
sudden emergence of people like me right?"
"Ah...."
Then, with his thoughts back to the place where he originally premeditated,
Sora said.
"—It's safe to assume that the enemy is prepared. Preparing something
that even in this case, can also implement the smooth use of cheats."
........
Suddenly, because of Steph's words, Sora acted as if he thought of
something and quickly added.
"Steph, do you remember that human species can't use magic, but can
play with『Magic-driven games』right?"
"Ah, yeah..."
As if pondering on the answer, Sora exposed a candid expression.
"You also said that『Elf are the most adept at using magic』right. So you
might never have guessed that in response to other countries competitions
that have technologies able to detect magic, they will embed an even more

complex and less prone to be discovered magic into a game right— I'm
afraid that she is going to get『That』."
However, that sentence dulled down Steph's expression.
".......Then, if that happens. Wouldn't it make things much more difficult for
you?"
—Huh? Why?"
"Eh? Because if it was a complex magic—"
This question has been repeated a couple of times already, Sora sighed
yet again.
"I said— towards us humans who are too pure,『Memory
tampering』and『Visual reading』those kind of pure magic are humans
greatest threat, after all, there is no way to detect it. But if you are going to
use a game that is the same as gambling for the country, that kind of
magic won't be used."
Which also means, a game that appears on the [Surface].
But the fact is that it is included with an overwhelming advantage for the
user.
And being unable to perceive it— interference won't be made from the
outside party.
Most likely, an absolutely beneficial cheat will be set up.
But, the constant『Victory』like when challenging Steph will cease to
exist.
In order to allow them to come up with that plan.
For that purpose, the phone was used.
Now, everything was going according to their ways.
".......Bu, but."
Suddenly, as if understanding, Steph uttered the right opinion.
"Even so—you can't change the『Overwhelming disadvantage』right?"
"Ah, yeah. Is there a problem with that?"

But, Sora answered without a care, sitting on the bench while hugging
Shiro, he replied.
"As long as it is a game that can be won in theory, for 『
impossible."

』, losing is

"...........Un."
Just when Shiro had won against the chess application installed in her
phone set in the highest difficulty, she endorsed by nodding.
.....—At this time.
As if noticing something, Shiro turned her head.
From the approaching silhouette—it was Kurami who had spent a
considerable amount of time making them wait.
"........No good, did she overhear our conversation just now."
Sora murmured to Shiro in a voice audible to her only, in which she
responded by nodding her head.
—[Don't worry], was what it was implied to be.
As if affirming her answer, the first word that Kurami spoke out was,
"—I'll be straightforward and ask. You spies, where are you from?"
Sora felt relief in his heart, but prevented it from showing on his face,
merely laughing and replied her.
"Ah, yes, in fact, we are from some country— oi, do you really think I would
say that? Are you an idiot?"
"—I will not hand over this country."
"I already know oh? Because you want to give it to the elves right~~"
"..Wrong."
Sora laughed while throwing out provocations, but Kurami's serious
expression was in strong denial.
"I won't hand it to anyone. Imanity's country, belongs to Imanity alone."
"—Oh?"

For an [Oh, what an unexpected answer], Sora urged her to continue
saying, in which Kurami complies by asserting.
"Using the elf's strength, is to ensure the survival circle of
Mankind—although you can't possible imagine what a complex contract I
had to exchange to achieve this motive........and to when it is necessary to
hand over the territory— I will sever all ties with the elves."
—Whoa.....
Even if it's Sora, he can't help it but have a mood as if embracing his head.
With a wry smile, she said words that came from her heart
"Exposing the plan and suspecting the elf as a spy, are you an idiot? Do
you want to die?"
But, the confidence conveyed through Kurami's eyes could be seen
through the veil, staring at Sora.
".............No matter which country's spy you are from, you can never win
against me oh?"
"Oh.........such great confidence you have there."
"But I'm just telling the truth oh. This world's biggest country 『Aylwin
Gerudo』—an impenetrable fortress that even the magical race like elfs
can't even win. Precisely because of this, it was known as the "Largest
country", having an engagement with it is surely defeat, without an
exception."
.......Un.
".........I'm a human—"
Relaxing her serious gaze, Kurami said while looking at Sora's eyes.
"I'll advise you, if you still have some heart for this country, for the sake of
Imanity, I hope you will give up on your spy task and stop this fight. I swear
that I am definitely not the puppet of the elves."
"......."
Facing the words which sounded like a plea, Sora did not utter a word.
"—Unable to use magic, even perceiving it is impossible—us humans."

Her face covered by the black veil, Kurami hinted out an expression of
unwillingness.
"If you want to survive in this world—it can be achieved by living under the
shelter of a country and obtaining『Rights to live』, then abandoning the
victory or defeat and closed up. You understand me?"
....Oh.
Complying to the ten oaths, the challenged party has the right to decide
the contents of the game.
Indeed, borrowing strength from the strongest species could certainly get a
territory.
Rejecting all games and practising isolation was the most efficient and
effective strategy.
Able to obtain nothing else, at the same time, able to keep everything else.
It's just like chess, where the strongest line up is on hold.
However, towards this words—
"............Un, so that's how it really is.........it's definitely not a bad plan. I
have known this already......:"
"Then, you will surrender right......"
As if in gratitude, Kurami closed her eyes—
"However,
"I reject!"
Blurting out these words caused her eyes to widen in response.
"—Reason......could you tell me why?"
"Hehe, that's because....."
Sora hugged his little sister who was watching with an expression that
could not be discern.
"One of our most favorite things for 『

』is—"

""Standing in a position where the opponent has an advantage and deny
with a 『NO』!""
Like a chorus, both Sora and Shiro combined together.
Originally unclear of the plot, Steph and Kurami could not arrange this
reasoning properly.
Only looking at the excited siblings while feeling stunned.
"Wahaha!『I always wanted to try and say the number four lines[23]
』—and I really said it out!"
".......Nii, very, goodjob."
Seeing the siblings raising a thumbs up, Kurami's shoulders started to
tremble.
Was it a provocation, or simply no room for any more negotiation.
"—Looks like I have wasted my time. I will beat you down with the power
you so desire to fight so much...........I'll be waiting in the hall."
"Yes~~yes~~. Go and prepare『the borrowed power that people fawn over
』"
While watching her leave, Sora deliberately threw out some offensive
words.
"Is, is that alright? What she said, I think there is some truth in it......"
"—About that, I think its time for you to [suspect others] right?"
Sora said while putting up his finger.
"One, where is the basis for the verified claims she is saying."
"Ah...."
Feeling slightly embarrassed as she understands it, Steph shyly lowered
her hear. Ignoring her actions, Sora put up his second finger and
continued.
"Two, if you really have the means to win, then why did she bother coming
here to persuade us into abandoning our duel?"

"......Ah!"
Probably noticing the key points, Steph raised her head.
"To lessen the chance of her failing.............use the means to win without
having to duel—!?"
That is to say— the expected result Sora had thought.
Getting a rare answer that was correct from Steph, Sora smiled while
putting up his third and fourth fingers.
"Three, even if what she said was true, she can't disclose that sort of
information to people who are suspected to be spies from other country.
And lastly, we are finished if they figured out our playing cards, ok?"
Greatly opening her mouth, Steph could not help but nod excessively.
"So, so careful consideration was put in before saying those words eh......."
.......Of course Steph wouldn't know about the plot.
Gazing at Sora with candor, she realised her cheeks were flushed and
panickingly shook her head.
However, Sora was staring at the direction where Kurami left— the
passage that leads straight to the hall of King City.
"......But then, it doesn't end like that. That guy—is similar to you."
Shifting his gaze to Shiro.
With a nod, Shiro took steps to move forward.
"—A bit, she underestimates us humans."

Part 3
Returning to the hall.
What greeted their eyes was a large audience filling the hall, who had
probably been waiting the whole time.
And then in front of the throne there stood a small table, and a pair of
chairs.
On top of the table was—

"A chessboard...?"
This time—the one confused was Sora. An unfair game infused with the
elves' magic... He had considered many possibilities but—chess was
outside of his imagination. After all—how exactly do you cheat in chess?
Sora was concerned about this being slightly out of his expectation.
However Kurami sat in one of the chairs, and in a monotonous voice
explained.
"Yes, chess. But this is not just normal chess."
Saying this she took out a small box, and scattered the pieces on the
board.
—Then.
The 32 pieces, 16 each of black and white, each moved into position by
themselves, as if sliding on the board.
It was as if—
"That's right, this is chess where 'the pieces have their own wills'."
As if reading Sora's thoughts, Kurami answered.
"The pieces move automatically. Just give a command, and the pieces will
move according to the command."
"...I see. That's how it'll be, huh."
—She brought a troublesome game.
Sora thought through the possible ways she could cheat in his mind, and
clicked his tongue.
"...What do we do, Shiro."
If it was regular chess, then Shiro would definitely winBut that was only if it
was regular chess.
Not to mention that the opponent had definitely put in some magic,
intending to cheat.
"...Don't worry, if it's chess... I can't lose."
Saying this, Shiro boldly walked forward.

—But, before that, Sora confirmed.
"Hey, it's fine if we switch in the middle right?"
""—?""
The ones surprised were Kurami, as well as Shiro.
"Unfortunately, the two of us here are one player. Also, that seems to be a
game that only one side is familiar with. It's to even the playing field, right?"
While playing with his cellphone Sora said. As if trying to read his
intentions, Kurami stared into Sora's eyes. However, it didn't seem like she
managed to learn anything from Sora's eyes.
—Someone like that won't ever be equal to even one of 『

』's wings.

"—Do as you please."
Concerned about the cellphone in Sora's hands, or is it that she was alert
since she couldn't read anything from him. Kurami said, as if spitting out
the words—but.
"...Nii, do you think, Shiro will...?"
Unexpectedly protesting—was what was supposed to be the other wing,
his sister.
"Shiro, you're being too hotheaded. If it was regular chess then there's not
even a 10000 to 1 chance that you'd lose."
"...Nn."
Shiro nodded as if that was obvious.
Sora, too, was as serious as could be. There was no way she would lose.
—However.
"This is not just normal chess—it's as she says."
"..."
"Don't forget. The two of us are one, the two of us are
strongest). Okay?"
"...So...rry. I'll be... careful..."

[ ] (the

"All right! Then let's do this!"
He said, then patted Shiro's head—and then whispered beside her ear.
"—Until I see through their cheating and come up with a plan, go win this."
Nodding in confirmation, Shiro slowly approached the table.
"Are you done talking?—Then let's start, you can have the first move."
"...—"
Towards this obvious challenge, Shiro frowned for a moment.
Chess was 'no different from tic-tac-toe', was what Shiro had said.
What she said was no less than giving up the win.
Because chess is a game where if both players played optimally, then
theoretically [the first player wins].
For someone moving second, it would require the opponent to make at
least one mistake to even start thinking about a [tie].
"...b2 pawn, b4."
With a slightly spoiled mood, Shiro said, and the match started.
Not by moving with their hands, but by issuing voice commands, the
chessboard where the pieces automatically move.
Following the rules, limited to the first move, the pawn moved forward 2
squares.
—But, Kurami had said.
'The pieces have their own wills'.
There was no way that was referring to just moving automatically—.
While Sora was immersed in thought, Kurami quietly muttered.
"Pawn number 7, 'forward'."
Instantly—the commanded pawn.
——Moved forward 3 squares"""—Huh!?"""

The people who raised their voice were Sora as well as the audience.
"These are 'pieces with their own wills'—didn't I say so?"
A light smile appearing on her face, Kurami spoke.
"The pieces reflect the player's 'charisma', 'commanding ability', 'guiding
ability', 'right to be king', and move according to that—don't you think it's a
suitable game for deciding the king?"
"—tch."
Sora clicked his tongue—but there was no need to panic.
"...d2 pawn, d3."
Simply and calmly, Shiro continued to play, .
"Ara, is that okay, to be playing so leisurely?"
...However, provocations have no use against Shiro once she starts
playing.
Also, there was the brother in reserve. Shiro's overwhelming concentration.
Can even destroy gods...And then. In reality.
Unfazed by Kurami's pieces continuously moving against the rules. Not
even falling into danger once, Shiro continued moving her pieces—
"...I see."
Fearing a certain thing, Sora.
If it was as Kurami said, and in this game the 'pieces with their own wills'
were the key, then— that fear was very soon brought to reality.
"Pawn 5, forward."
The commanded piece—.
Did not move.
"...Eh?"
For the first time since coming here, Shiro showed a confused expression.
Similarly, Steph and the audience had the same confusion.
"—As I thought, it's like that huh."

Clicking his tongue because his prediction came true, Sora. In other words.
The key to this chess game being that with charisma then the pieces will
move ignoring the rules—was wrong. 'That the pieces won't move without
enough charisma' was the real key. If the pieces were real [soldiers] then
first of all a strategy that could not be used normally— that was,
"We can't [sacrifice pieces], huh."
—For the sake of the war, happily giving up their lives, such soldiers
normally didn't exist. The thorough commands, orders—combined with the
madness that was the initial burst of morale had made this strategy
possible in the beginning. But now that 'sacrificing pieces' had been
sealed—
"—"
Shiro bit her nails, and for the first time entered a long thought.
...That's right—the tactics available were mostly limited. However the
soldiers of the lightly smiling Kurami were, without any disorder, continuing
to move...It was the first time they were pushing back against Shiro, who
had an advantage, but it didn't take long.
—The situation quickly worsened. With their morale diminished the pieces
started ignoring commands more often, and Shiro was growing
increasingly frustrated. The frustration of the commander transmitted to the
soldiers, making the situation even worse—...If this continues, then there
was no hope.
"..."
She probably realized it herself—that there was no longer any way for
Shiro to win.
However—it was enoughShiro held the match, which allowed Sora to
observe.
With the eyes like a zombie, filled with self-scorn, no matter how you look
at it there was no sign of anything like charisma. The movement of
Kurami's pieces told him 120% of the real form of the cheating.
—Placing his hand on his sister's shoulder, Sora said.

"Shiro, let's switch."
"..."
His sister's downcast eyes were hidden by the long white hair. But, he
could tell that she probably hid a thin layer of tears.
—That was to be expected. 『 』 does not permit any losses. Especially
in chess—which his sister had not once lost in.
"......Nii... So...rry."
"—What's wrong."
".........I... lost...... so... rr... y."
Saying this, Shiro buried her face in her brother's chest. But, hugging that
head, Sora said.
"Huh? What are you saying, we haven't lost yet."
"......"
"—The two of us together are 『
a loss."

』 —until I lose too, it doesn't count as

Shiro looked up at Sora, who said this. The expression that he showed
was his usual arrogance—that it was impossible to lose, confidence.
"Also, this isn't chess—in this game, you have not beaten me even once."
"...eh...?"
"Well, just watch—this game is in my field of responsibility."
Sniff, sniff, then.
Rubbing the tears from his sister's eyes, covered by her bangs, Sora. He
couldn't tell her expression from her lowered head, but he could tell she
was still down. The sister started getting up from the chair as urged—but
Sora stopped her.
"A crybaby, huh. A child that leaves in the middle of a match, and a naive
brother that thinks he can make a comeback at this point... it does seem
like the two of you have the qualifications to be King. That is, the
qualifications to be a joke of a king."

Ignoring those words by Kurami. Lifting the body of his sister off the
ground, Sora.
"...?"
Shiro's body stiffened due to suddenly being carried.
—Raising the overly light, even if she was only eleven, sister.
Reached the table and sat her on his knees, Sora.
"...?"
"Didn't I say, the two of us are 『
then please give me a hand."

』. We are here. And, if I lose my calm

To the speechless sister, Sora said.
With a smile, but with a bottomless eeriness, Sora spoke towards Kurami.
"Whew, what a pinch."—then.
"—Was that... said towards me?"
"In this cheating game that you got from the elves by selling this hole or
that hole, I'm gonna beat you, so you better start thinking about
apologies—the price for making my sister cry is high, you prostitute."
Kurami's face twitched, but he ignored that.
Facing towards the board, Sora. Taking a big breath of air—and then.
"TO ALL SOLDIERS!"
Including the sister sitting on his lap. Everyone in the hall covered their
ears, in a voice that shook the walls, he yelled.
"THOSE WHO EARN AN ACHIEVEMENT IN THIS BATTLE—BY THE
AUTHORITY OF THE KING, I GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO HAVE
INTERCOURSE WITH THE GIRL YOU LIKE ONCE!"
——.
Suddenly, a silence like the bottom of the sea wrapped around the castle.
What the silence signified was—confusion, contempt, amazement. But, not
caring about this, Sora continued.

"Furthermore! All of you soldiers who fight on the front line, after this battle
is won you will be freed from further military service, and from the
responsibilities to pay tax for life! The country will guarantee you veteran
benefits! Therefore—don't you die a virgin! Also, those with family or loved
ones waiting—you must all return alive!"
Due to the exceedingly vulgar speech, once again the castle replied with
silence.
—However. From the chess board.
"UwooooOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHhHHHH!!"
—A war cry resounded.
A strict contrast to what was going on inside the castle. But the speech had
not ended.
"To my army, to my men! Lend your ears to my words! This battle is
ours—Alkia's, mankind's! It's a battle to decide who rules this city, our last
fort, and thus one that decides the fate of mankind! Listen well! Open your
eyes and look, at the king of that country—"
Then, suddenly, at his opponent—Kurami, he pointed and yelled.
"Leaving it to this zombie-like idiot, this bitch lacking in intelligence, are you
really okay with that!"
"Wha—"
Then, ignoring the stunned Kurami, he grabbed his dejected sister's
drooping head.
Sweeping away her bangs, exposing her face. Peeking out from behind
the pure white, albino long hair was a skin white like snow. Also revealed
were her beautiful ruby-like eyes, filled with a redness that seemed to suck
one in—but they were dyed with sadness.
"If we achieve victory, then she will be the queen! That's right, think about
what happened back then! To guide us to victory she closed her heart and
commanded you, but each of you dismissed her as [ruthless] and caused
her to cry! I'll only ask once—"
"CAN YOU STILL CALL YOURSELVES MENNNNNNN!"
Then, immediately, he gave an order to a pawn.

"To the seventh pawn squadron! The enemy is invading our front lines! If
we just wait in this stalemate, then we'll be hit from the sides—[rush and
flank them!]—secure the initiative!"
Then, as if responding to that shout. The pawn moved forward 2 squares,
then continued and flanked the enemy pawn—destroying it.
"Wh—impossible!?"
Towards the bewildered Kurami, Sora spoke with a huge grin.
"Hmm? It something that you've done too, is there something to be
surprised about?"
"—Grrr..."
But, the sister on Sora's lap muttered.
"...If this was a real battle... then with this the soldier should be tired... and
can't move for a while."
"Yeah, it's as you say, but—second cavalry team! Don't let go of the
opportunity that the seventh pawn squadron opened! No matter what
protect the 'heroes' that cut open the path!"
Then, without waiting for the opponent's turn, he continued.
"And then the king and queen over there! In other words you are the two of
us but hurry and move towards the front lines."
—At these commands that were impossible according to chess's rules, the
audience, and even Shiro, opened their eyes wide.
Well—in the first place.
"H, hey! What are you doing ignoring my turns—!"
—Kurami complained, but with a look like pitying a wild dog, Sora said.
"Huh? Are you an idiot? Is there anyone who waits for their opponent's turn
in a real war?"
In the first place, the pieces were moving. In other words, they were
processing the commands.
"If you're worried about your turn, then why don't you give commands
before I do, stupid♥"

If you have a problem then say it to the chessboard, is what he left it with.
In one breath, throwing out absurd arguments one after another like they
made sense, Sora. But—the reality is that the pieces moved. Which means
that there was nothing wrong with this. In that case—
"Guuuu—pawns, advance in order! Build a defense wall!!"
Urgently throwing out counter-commands, Kurami.
Immediately, Sora found a flaw.
"Hah! Look, their troops are hiding themselves behind walls, look at their
cowardly form!"
With an exaggerated wave of his hand, in perfect acting, he yelled.
"Leaving the soldiers to fight in the front lines and waiting in the back, what
kind of king, what kind of queen are you! The king and the queen—the
rulers, are the ones who should guide the citizens —To everyone we
continue, the proud knights, bishops, and rooks! Now is the time to work
according to your titles! Protect the infantry(pawns) and 'prove yourself'!"
—Slandering the opponent's tactics, though underhanded it raised morale.
Encouraged by the speech which would've been called [propaganda
tactics] in the real world, the pieces hurriedly moved. Then, once again
towards Kurami—and also towards the pieces that she led, he said.
"Hmpf—using the elves' magic to forcefully raise the morale of your own
troops—it could be said in a real battle that—this would be called
[brainwashing magic], huh?"
"—"
Kurami's expression distorted slightly.
If you think that wouldn't have been enough for him to realize he hit the
bull's-eye, then you'd be way underestimating the boy named Sora.
"I see, it would be hard to prove, and would bring a crushing advantage in
this game. Even if the opponent is an expert in chess, unable to predict the
movement of the pieces, unable to even sacrifice pieces, they would fall
into disorder..."
He placed his hand on his sister's head.
"But, you made a big [miscalculation]."

Then, once again he resumed his speech in a loud voice.
"Since antiquity, there had never been cases where kings who
commanded their army tyrannically were referred to as great kings,
because more than anything people fight only for justice—and, there is
only one absolute justice in this world!"
Usually, the spiritless younger sister with eyes half closed. The
continuation of the situation where she suddenly opened her eyes. In that
face—her eyes snapped open, showing the face of a beautiful girl who
would enchant anyone who looked at her.
"You are in the presence of the queen! If you bastards are men then don't
let those eyes fill with tears again!"
—As if in reply.
Once again from the board, a war cry that shook the table resounded.
"—That's right... [Cuteness], that is the only unchanging justice in this
world."
Hugging the sister sitting on his lap, Sora boldly declared.
The only response came from the board, creating an amazing temperature
difference compared to the room—but he paid no attention to that. There
was no way that the residents of this world who knew no battles would
understand.
—The reason men risk their lives and fight, no matter which world it was
this didn't change.
That is, for their loved ones. For the honor in order to charm their loved
ones. To say it bluntly.
—It was for the sake of [eroticism]... there was no other way to say it...
"—Pawn number 5! Destroy the opponent's knight!"
The pawn that Kurami ordered attacked his army's knight—but.
Embracing his sister in one hand, he stood up from the chair, swinging his
arm Sora yelled!
"Oh honourable knight, trained by us and bestowed by the queen with the
title of knight, are you at the level of being defeated by a measly pawn!

With the name of the queen, as well as your title on the line, I will not allow
you to die without permission! The enemy is just a single soldier, it can't do
anything but take your back. Turn around and retreat, maintain the
line—break open a path to survival with your sword and shield!"
As the pawn that should've been attacking captured the knight—
Right before that, instead, it broke apart""—Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!?""
From Steph to Kurami, everyone in the castle let out a similar sound.
However, that sound did not reach him.
Really placing himself in the battle, Sora once again yelled.
"You have fought well, you have endured well, oh valiant knight! That is
what it truly means to be the sword of the people! —But, for now you
should rest that sword for a while and recover! The reward for your actions
on the battlefield today, I swear on my name to provide it to you!"
As he did so, the knight—a mere chess piece. Turned towards Sora—no...
towards the [king]. An action as if giving a bow—poof, disappearing from
the top of the board, moving to the side of the table.
—A situation which is impossible in chess, [simultaneous kill]. At a loss of
words, Kurami, and as if mocking her, Sora responded.
"Ha ha ha, you idiot. A chess that emulates a real battle? Against an
opponent like me who has never lost in Civilization or Daisenryaku, did you
think you could win in a simplified version like this game?"
That's right—this was not chess. This was a [strategy game]. A magic that
maintains the morale—that is indeed a rather advantageous magic. But
something like that was worth no more than something that maintains the
statuses of the social systems or the wonders of the world. Also—the
weaknesses of those systems, he was also familiar with.
In essence, that was the playing style that results from relying on those
effects— If the opponent's playing style could be grasped—
It could not longer be called a match.
"Third pawn squadron! Seize the chance—take down the enemy bishop!"

Confidently, aiming straight for checkmate, Sora yelled out a command,
and the piece faithfully moved to follow it. But, just before reaching the
bishop—
—The pawn was dyed black"""—Wha!?"""
The audience let out a shocked voice. But that had already become
something of a norm. But, for the first time—Sora had been part of that
group. Kurami could clearly tell from Sora's expression that the
phenomenon had been out of his expectations. Hehe... with a thin, dark
smile, Kurami spoke.
"Brainwashing—it can cause some pretty interesting results. With
brainwashing then it's definitely possible, something like this."
Forcibly turning the attacking piece black.
'Forced brainwashing' —
In other words, all of the attacks from this side were completely sealed.
...Shit.
——Shit. Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit!
Without showing it on his face, Sora realized that he had made a fatal
mistake. He arbitrarily believed that the cheat the opponent had been
using was to 'maintain a crazed morale amongst the troops'.
—The mistake he had so arrogantly pointed out to Steph a few days ago
had come and bitten himself.
I failed—failed failed failed failed! What a grave blunder—! That is, when
the threat of losing approaches imminently, without caring whether the use
of magic becomes exposed—the possibility of risking a cheat that might
have been detected as abnormal in the face of loss—!
Why didn't I consider this—I'm such an idiot!
"—All units, retreat! The enemy is using brainwashing magic, do not
approach them!"
With Sora's overwhelming leadership, even the pieces that should not be
able to retreat started to retreat. However,

"Fufu, trying to be a war king? A king trying to be a rear guard, stop
messing around."
Seeing the tides change, Kurami barked an order against the [king]—in
other words, at [Sora].
The enemy queen approached.
"Behead the enemy king, my queen! Checkmate!"
"Brother..."
The hall grew noisy, even Shiro felt the danger, and raised her voice.
But—towards the approaching piece, Sora said.
"—Oh queen, please lower thy sword... for thou art—beautiful."
......
"""—Huh?"""
With the audience, Kurami, and even Shiro stunned, Sora passionately
and fervently started to coax the piece—the queen.
"Ahh, dear queen. Dost thou serveth that king of thy own will, or hast thee
other reasons—but prithee, listen to thy heart. Is that king one worthy of
thy service?"
Like a first-rate theatrician. With a sweet voice like the playboy of the
century, Sora unleased his beautifully woven words. It was as if he was a
handsome young king on the battlefield.
"Brainwashing the soldiers, the citizens, and using them as swords, as
tools— moreover, for he who made you stand up to everything yet remains
frightened within, is such a king worth swinging thy sword and flaunting thy
beauty for?! Oh dear beautiful queen, it is but cursed fate that brought us
to meet as this, as enemies. Prithee, lower your blade, and take a good
look—your people, those who should be protected—your king! Where are
they now!"
—Clang—.
A sound as if a sword dropping to the ground echoed.

—This time, the black queen became dyed in white. Not even a sound
could longer be heard from the dumbfounded gallery. The only sounds
came from Kurami who was lost for words, and the slightly snickering Sora.
"——Wha——"
"Kukuku, galge[24] are one of the few games where I'm better than my
sister."
"—Y-you..."
Hearing Kurami grinding her teeth, the audience sighed, as if relieved. As
long as Sora could do the same thing as the enemy, the situation is back
to a draw—is what they probably thought.
—But that was not true. It was completely wrong. This was—no more than
something that could only be done because it had been Sora and the
enemy queen. But Kurami—though it could not be confirmed, but it
seemed like she could brainwash any piece. While sealing off his attacks
completely—the enemy could attack without holding back. The only thing
that awaits ahead—are the two words 'certain defeat'.
—What do I do. What do I do Sora, you 18 year old virgin—!
Sora tried with all his power to keep the composed smile on his face from
collapsing. His mind fiercely searched for a way to somehow overcome this
situation. Well—to be accurate, he had found a way.
There is—a way. It's a possibility... but will the opponent fall for it!?
—It was an all or nothing gamble. If it succeeded then for the moment he
could hang on. But if it failed—then his chance of victory would be
completely crushed. Compared with the risk of the gamble, the merits are
only temporary—would it be a good choice? While the excessive secretion
of hormones in his brain even compressed time, Sora continued to think.
But this time, Shiro. She gently—enveloped her brother's face with those
two small hands.
"——Wh...?"
Suddenly feeling the warmth on his cheeks, his body trembled slightly.
However, Shiro looked Sora in the eyes, and in a small voice continued.
"...Nii, you said... calm down, when you're back, help."

"——"
"...The two of us are... 『

』..."

Ahh...
"—Yeah, you're right..."
"......Are you, okay?"
—Do you think it will work?
The brother's eyes silently asked, and the sister, slightly, but strongly,
...Nodded.
—Right, Shiro—this genius girl—his proud sister. Against an opponent who
moved without regards to the rules, using only pure chess moves she had
once held the upper hand. That could not be possible unless she could
read what the opponent—Kurami, will do. In psychological tactics, the
brother was largely superior to the sister—however.
Once again, Sora thought to himself.
—Don't forget. His sister—had even defeated God. That sister, from purely
evaluating the situation, had asserted that it will work. Then, what he must
do is believe in his sister, and with that as the premise, construct a
strategy! Then—Kurami, with her shoulders shaking.
"—Knight! Cut down the double-crossing queen!"
——She fell for it... The thoroughly rigged—trap. The commanded black
knight shook as if in inner conflict, and then—
It turned white.
"W-why... w-what did you do!?"
—This was it. This was the one and only way to survive. Something that
Kurami would not be able to stand if she was really fighting for humankind,
and her [reaction] towards that betrayal. Also that she was even now
thinking that we were also using some kind of cheat... That was—the
outline of the only remaining way to achieve victory. Ahh, to be expected of
my sister.

Conveying this by patting the sister's head, the sister closed her eyes in
comfort as if a cat. Then, as if it was all as planned, Sora spoke with an
indomitable smile.
"Oh King, oh foolish king. To have thy vassal to slay thy queen... what a
cruel command. Thou would doest well to calm down. Those shoulders
shaking with anger—they are not what the citizens should see."
"You—traitor...!"
Believing Sora to have sold out the humans and was using the assistance
of other countries to cheat, Kurami. On that face was not the zombie-like
sense of helplessness or sense of responsibility that had been there until
now, it was pure anger. In comparison, Sora's face was arrogant, fearless,
and filled with confidence.
...But who would have sensed it at that time.
That even right this moment, Sora was the one who, heart pulsing with a
force as if it would break, was mobilizing all his thought power. Sora's brain
was still, limited to the knowledge he gained through various quiz games
and history games. Recreating battles to the limit of what he knew, and
running simulations.
—That's right, the situation hadn't turned for the better in the slightest.
This tactic was not something that could be repeatedly used. It was merely
a one time bluff to plant the seed of doubt in the opponent. It was a
dangerous tightrope where just another attack could cause everything to
fail. In that case—the only way is to win without fighting——
Win without fighting?
——
—And then.
In this situation that was equal to [certain defeat].
Sora finally saw a speck of light.
"—Shiro. I'll leave the command of the troops to you. Can you maneuver
them so they will not be brainwashed?"
"...No, problem."

Without asking for the reason, the sister saluted and took control of the
troops.
—This was, once more, an all or nothing gamble. However, this time it was
a gamble for a guaranteed win. There were only two ways to come out
victorious in this situation. As far as Sora's knowledge goes, the way to win
without fighting—which is.
"Oh dear queen—"
Leaving the sister the control, Sora started to talk to the now allied,
ex-enemy queen.
"I cannot bring myself to order thee—nor thy faithful, proud knights who
lowered their swords, to turn thy weapons towards thy own citizens—thy
brethren. This battle, this situation... that it is no longer but a meritless
brawl should be clear to anyone—thy king—is now but a crucible of
madness."
Then, Sora, within the span of the seconds hand making a full revolution.
Several thousand lines of words spun through his brain, and came out as
the gamble(persuasion) of the century.
"Thy citizens are thy citizens—the one to guide them in place of the [mad
king] can be no other than thee—are there any objections!"
Sora's speech. Its aim. Not one person in the castle, not even Kurami
could uncover it. Thus the castle replied with silence—just like the many
times that had happened up to now. Waiting for the something that would
exceed all expectations—they waited in silence. Then—finally, a result that
was probably the answer to those anticipations.
The originally black queen—but what is now a white queen.
—This time became dyed in redIn addition, the black pieces in the front
line mostly turned red.
"———Huuuuuh!?"
Kurami was the one and only person who screamed out. Probably, none of
the other audience members had been able to comprehend what just
happened. However, with the continuation of Sora's act—they were finally
able to grasp the situation.

"I commendeth thee for taking a stand, oh respectable and brave queen!
Righteous ones who overcame thy brainwashing to follow thy queen! I
shant telleth thee to cut down thy brethren! Furthermore, I doth not believe
that thy brethren wishes to cut thee! The ones who shall mark the end of
the tyrannous reign of the mad king who steals the freedom of his subjects
repeatedly through brainwashing, is none other than thee!"
That's right, this is.
Inciting a [revolution]—the advent of a third power"I doth not wish for
bloodshed! Like what any would wish for—I wish for peace! I wish for both
sides to lay down their swords. I will not allow any more blood to flow!"
Following the pronouncement, one by one, the number of red pieces by
the red queen's side increased.
—Though they might have no hesitation in cutting down their enemies.
But.
"—Y-you, it doesn't matter! Dispose of all traitors!"
Consumed by rage and still not understanding the situation, Kurami once
again—fell into a trap.
"You have made yet another mistake, oh foolish king. Since old, dealing
with revolutions through 'Military Oppression' is the worst possible
strategy."
—Though they have no hesitation in cutting down their enemies. Even
under the effects of brainwashing magic—it is not easy to cut down
comrade-in-arms. As Sora spoke, the pieces that Kurami commanded
turned red one by one.
"—Wh... this... what happened, what kind of tricks did you pull!"
She who tried to protect mankind going as far as to borrow the elves'
power, Kurami. That feeling, strengthened by the feelings from being
betrayed, stole her composure.
"... All units, support, the red queen... expand the perimeter... don't, let
anyone, die."
Following Sora's intentions, through precise orders, Shiro was able to even
mobilize the red pieces strategically. It wasn't anything spectacular. It was

just to use the pieces that Kurami's army would have a hard time attacking,
the red queen's forces, as a shield. To put it another way, she manipulated
the pieces in the red queen's forces to create a situation where attacks
from both sides would be ineffective.
—The result.
"To all soldiers, take the enemy king's head at all costs... you should all
just move according to my commands—cut down and dispose of all
traitors."
Sora couldn't—Imanity couldn't feel anything. But, probably an even
stronger brainwashing magic had been cast. Eerily, silently, the black army
started its advance. Red pieces or white pieces. The aura exuding from the
marching pieces clearly showed that the black army would annihilate
everything, as those in the castle held their breath.
"...Brother, to block off... the path of retreat of a weakened enemy, ends
like this."
As a slight amount of cold sweat started to form, even the sister pointed
and said. However, Sora replied with a smile.
"I know—that's why I did it."
Crack—
Such a sound, without any reason, suddenly resounded.
The black king, in other words Kurami's king.
—Cracks started running across.
"—Eh—wh, what?"
The cracks spread across the black king. Towards the confused Kurami
staring stupefied, Sora answered disinterestedly.
"A tyrant that continues oppressing, ruling through fear, and
brainwashing—is a strange thing."
This was—[the second way] that Sora knew—of how to 'win without
fighting'.

"It's fine while he continues winning, but if ever he lost, no matter which
world it is, for some reason the end of that ruler, as if set in stone, is
known."
...That is.
"Their end will be due to an assassination by someone close to them who
is not even a soldier."
—This was something that had been repeated many times in history, a
historical fact of Sora's world. In essence, let the brainwashing expand,
make them not care about appearance. After establishing the 'tyrant', force
them closer to defeat. As they begin to move as a 'mad king'—'self
destruction'.
Then, the cracking black king crumbled. Everyone in the castle, Kurami
including, stared wordlessly.
"Sorry but, our world is not as nice a place as this world."
Winning, standing up from the chair, Sora and Shiro.
"—About wars or killing bouts, we're experts compared with you guys."
Then, a large sigh. Exchanging a light high-five with Shiro, Sora stared
towards the horizon. Towards their original world. As if looking far off into
the distance, he squinted his eyes.
"This stays only within a game. Ahh, it's a good world, this place..."
...So, he muttered.

Part 4
"How, how amazing....."
—An abnormal, overwhelming and wonderful victory.
The only person whispering in the midst of all that cheering in the castle,
was Steph.
Perhaps the audience that sent out all those cheers did not know the truth.
But Steph had understood it completely.

However, this does not mean that she could comprehend the tactics and
significant lines said by those two.
Because she herself did not know what was their world like.
But.
That person— Kurami, was backed by extremely powerful elves.
Just before the start of the duel, magic was incorporated into the game to
allow cheating.
And both of them directly challenged and defeated the opponent. Only she
understood this fact.
Which means— albeit indirectly
Fighting against the world's largest kingdom, Avant Heim, would definitely
be beaten down.
It means races that are driven by magic gained an insight, mere humans
could also achieve victory from their hands.
Historically, this had not even happened before.
So—
"........Are they really, humans?"
Fear— with fear slowly growing inside her heart, Steph whispered out.
In total contrast with the heated atmosphere of the city, the defeated
Kurami lowered her head while remaining silent.
Without even giving her a glance, the siblings gallantly left the table.
For this pair of siblings that was walking towards herself—
Steph momentarily forgot what she had to do.
—Because this can't be helped right?
Rightfully defeating the absolute enemy that manipulated magic, yet they
didn't even feel the joy of winning at all.
—"Defeat that doesn't exist for 『

』".........

Generally proving this statement, she stood in front of the two victors with a
completely natural look, wondering what she should say in the end.
However— completely unaware of the entanglement in Steph's heart, Sora
said with a frivolous tone.
"—Is this fine now?"
"..........Eh?"
"Your grandpa—the Late King being as a fool, this criticism would not be
left behind for the future generations, right?"
"—Ah....."
"If letting no other, but Imanity's strongest 『
will be known as a virtuous king."

』to become the king— he

".......This way, Elchea.........will not perish, great, is it not..........Steph?"
Although she felt troubled and confused with their words.
She once again recalled the reason for their actions.
But being able to get a satisfying result despite of all that had happened.
With tears trickling down from her eyes, Steph said it bluntly.
"Thank you.......really—I am really grateful....."
Mixing with the little whimpers she was making, the sound produced was
difficult to identify.
However, Shiro tiptoed, and gently caressed Steph's head.
At this point, the tears which could no longer be suppressed gushed out
from Stephanie Dora's eyes.

—At this time.
".......Ne"
A whisper which was inadvertently leaked out from Kurami's mouth, got
covered up by the loud cheering from the crowd.
But, these words were clearly heard by Sora, Shiro and Steph.
"Please tell me.........what kind of tricks did you guys use."
Coldly muttering, Kurami stared at Sora with sharp eyes, before continuing.
"Ah, you were indeed right. I did borrow the strength of the elves, the only
measure to ensure that humans survive. But this is completely destroyed
by you. Answer me, where did you spies come from? Don't you think about
saying that you are just mere humans that could defeat elven magic!"
In her eyes, Sora was tantamount to a despicable enemy who had
abandoned his own kind, before questioning him.
While watching Kurami with eyes full of hatred, Steph gasped— but for the
siblings,
"We were planing on saying that , and it's the truth."
".........What, problem?"
Because Sora was strolling towards Kurami, the heated cheers in the City
instantly died down.
"To be truthful, if you can prove what you say, that you were merely
borrowing the power of the elf for the sake of human kind, then I really
think that that's not a bad strategy, and is not impossible to make me
abandon this game."
"Since it's like that—!"
"But, I can't stand your ideals."
Without the usage of any acting, Sora used contempting eyes to look down
on Kurami.
"Disregarding the words of [Using elven magic as a pedal], but if it was
interpreted as [Can't live normally without the shelter of elf-sama], it would
be so degrading that it makes people scoff."

"—Doesn't our matter, history, and situation prove that this is the limit of
what the human species can do!"
Using a tone that implies that a trick was obviously used, yet having the
audacity to teach me a lesson was Kurami.
"That was just some limit that a guy left could achieve, but that is not our
limit...."
Sourly finishing the sentence, Sora revealed a smile.
"For humans, humans have their own way of doing things. And also—
much gratitude to you who was convinced that we were also cheating,
which allowed us to achieve victory."
Hearing that line, Kurami sucked in air, and recalled the battle that
happened just now.
Although her own attention was completely focused on how to expose their
cheat, but what if.......
What if, from the start, they didn't even use any cheat at all?
"That kind of thing..........is impossible.........mere humans— are unable to
confront magic..........:"
"You are free to think of that, which is your own limit."
Narrowing both of his eyes.
"No matter if the opponent is Elf—or God, defeat doesn't exist in 『
dictionary."

』's

Saying that— as if trampling on her own self-esteem.
He grabbed hold of Kurami's chin, and ripped away the black veil covering
her face.
Looking at those eyes that stared straight, for the first time where anger
was present, Sora— said.
"Stop— underestimating humans!"
....Only this words.

The entire city fell silent.
Similar to being engraved in the heart, it kept echoing.
Similar to cutting off the strand of the『Most inferior species』.
Similar to a ray of light piercing through the perpetual darkness.
—Similar to the quiet hope of fire in everyone's heart that were ignited.
—Then, a sound leaked out from Kurami's mouth.
"Guu—"
".........Gu?"

"Guwahhahahhahahahahahahahhahhahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahah
"Whoa! What's happening!?"
Suddenly, Kurami sat on the floor and burst into tears.
Facing against the problem where you are too scared to deal with and
backed off was Sora— and sadly, censure could be not be added
anymore.
"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa idiot—stupid—! Just to get..............elf's strength
gugu, obv-obviously without formalities, how much trouble to conclude a
contract.......you guys, you guys ahhhhhhhhhh, I didn't underestimate~~~~I
was being serious——Wuhaaaaa.............."
With bean-like tears rolling down and crying out loudly, Kurami's action
dumbfounded everyone in the hall.
In the end, was this the reaction caused by someone who shouldered a
heavy load for liberation, or was this the character she had all along—
But, it was common for difficult children to cry in that world.
".........Nii.......made a girl........cry......"
"Eh, wait, this is my fault!?"
"Wuhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.....idiot.......stupid.....go die........."
In the scene where the audience were celebrating happily for the victory.

But now, they only watched from afar the soft cursings and whimpering of
Kurami—

Chapter 4
Part 1
While crying, Kurami kept scolding out Idiot and stupid.
'I will never admit it! I will absolutely expose you all—!'
Even up till the end when Kurami left, she kept kicking up a fuss.
"Aiyah aiyah.........what is the meaning of a human evaluating another
human eh........."
After Sora said these troubled words, the city was once again filled with
applause.
—Very fastidious about this victory.
Without any doubts, this victory had clearly showed that mankind still had a
sliver of chance.
With the hall completely bundled with the deafening cheers, an old official
walked towards Sora, holding onto a crown.
"Then, Sora-sama is it?"
"Yup."
"So you will be the one to ascend to the throne as the new king of Elchea,
right?"
"Can't do."
Hugging his little sister, he said while laughing.
"The two of us are 『 』— so the king belongs to us."
These were also the words he said during the chess duel.
With those words, the audience started an even higher-pitched applause—
for congratulating the new king and queen.
—However.
"—It's a pity, but that can't be done."
"—Eh?"

Hearing those words from the official, the cheers of the crowd halted.
"Ah? Eh, why?"
"The Ten Oaths stated that they can only elect a 『Sole representative』.
So two people cannot assume the post."
In the midst of the chattering hall, Sora and Shiro exchange glances.
Entering into a deep thought with a perturbed expression, Sora scratched
his head and furrowed his brow............before saying.
"............Ah, that, so be it, I'll be the one to be the representative, will that
work?"
".............Guu."
Gently releasing his little sister who was muttering, Sora faced the official.
"Then once again I'll announce—*cough cough*, from now, Sora-sama will
be the 255th generation king of Elchea— any objections please stand up,
otherwise remain silent—"
—But, unable to maintain that silence, someone raised up a hand and
interrupted the sentence.
"........Un."
A white-haired Shiro.
With her pair of ruby red eyes barely visible underneath her bangs, it was
the girl— who exactly said that,
"Eh? Shiro?"
".......I have, an objection."
"Gu, that, little sister, what are you doing?"
"........If, Nii, becomes king........Nii will build, harem."
"———————————Ah?"
Unable to believe what he had just heard, Sora could not help but ask, but
Shiro with an expression as if she was going to cry out said out.
".........That way........Shiro.........wouldn't be..........needed anymore."

Completely ignoring the stares from the stunned audience, Sora went into
a state of embarrassment he had never experienced before.
"Wait! Just, wait a moment, how is that possible! Aren't the both of us a
team! In the final conclusion, I'm just a king by name, I don't want Shiro to
do this kind of—"
"........But, the King is......Nii.........Shiro is just...............an accesory. If, it
there can only be one person..............the one to do it—"
Wiping away the tears, light was no longer reflected from her eyes.
".....to be the King— is Shiro."
The little sister who always felt weak, had clearly emitted an aura as if
declaring for war.
Facing Shiro who was intently staring at Sora, while announcing out her
intentions—
"—Ah?"
Getting stared, Sora changed his expression.
"Hey hey hey........My sister. It really is new for you to crack a joke, has the
sun finally risen up from the west?"
Although his frivolous actions and expression were the same as always.
There was definite hostility felt from his tone of voice.
"Let's see, a beautiful girl like you wanting to be the king of a collapsing
country. You are just too straightforward. You'll definitely get drawn in by
someone's sweet words— so if you want to be the King, your brother
absolutely forbades you from doing so!"
Although Sora opposed his little sister with words that can't be more hurtful
than that.
He worded it so that if interpreted correctly, it would be seen as though he
was spoiling his little sister, but his eyes were clearly not smiling.
".........No, won't, let Nii, become King— absolutely."
"—That's good. Nii also can't let you become the King, absolutely."
It was like a debate competition, where no one backs down.

Both of their interests intertwined and collided.
Even cracking the cheat by the Elves, and achieving the title of Imanity's
strongest Duo.
Their eyes belonged to neither a pair of loving siblings, nor the Duo player
called 『 』.
But opponents of a long history, constantly depending on each other's
vigor, with occasional sparks flying out upon collision with their eyesight.
"Th-that.....If that's the case, I will please invite both of you to have one
final battle, will this settle it all?"
Intervening between the two people probably took great courage.
Requiring confirmation, the official had to ask with an apologetic tone.
"Ah, that's fine."
"........No, problem."
An instantaneous answer coming out from both sides.
In a situation where their eyesight remains in contact, they issued out their
declaration of war.
"Little sister, I won't be lenient today oh. Today I will definitely make you
regret that."
".........Nii, should.......prepare yourself.........today, Shiro will, use her full
strength."
——………………
—Just like that.
Three days went past in a blink of an eye.
Continuously around the clock and after countless games, the central hall
was littered with various items.
The siblings were sprawled out on the floor.
"..........Ugh.....little bit more......you can admit defeat already."
"........Nii, is the one......hurry up and, give up."

The conditions for victory was two wins in a row, with that, the countless
number of games commenced.
And the outcome— It was currently at the 501th battle, with 158 wins, 158
losses and 184 draws.
—What was unfortunate, was that not just this place, even when the
siblings were in their 『Original World』.
『 』 which was regarded as an urban legend— nobody knew their
competition records.
But different from 『
combined.

』, which is attained when both their names are

It was the battles between these two people who loved games more than
anything else in the world.
And their record would be—
3526744 battles, 1170080 wins, 1170080 losses, 1186584 draws—
........So far, it had always been a stalemate between those two, no winner,
no loser.
Of course, everyone who weren't aware of this truth and were waiting for
the coronation ceremony to happen, had already gone home.
—Then gathered again, then went home again, a constant repetition, and
with the passing date, the number of audience that came gradually
reduced.
Those that worked tirelessly in the City fell asleep freely in the hall—and
barely maintaining their consciousness was Steph and the official who
started to see hallucinations after being awake for a long time.
The old official began to reveal strange smiles from time to time, before
switching back to his normal expression.
While Steph kept mouthing out "Ah, butterfly~", with an empty smile and
feebly trying to reach out for the emptiness.
—Then, what should the next game be.............Sora thought while in a
state of haziness for this problem.

However, a certain uncertainty flashed through his mind and he stopped
his action.
"—Fuu.............why must only one person hold the position of King?"
".....Eh?"
From this sentence, the Official and Steph snapped back into reality and
responded.
Blurting out those words, Sora retrieved his phone from his pocket.
Double confirming the 【Ten Oaths】 that he had recorded down, Sora
continued.
"【7】of the 『Ten Oaths』, All matters for group conflicts will be decided
by a representative....."
What it means here is, the group—which is also the country or inter-ethnic
conflict should be carried out by the decided representative.
—Even so.
As if trying to repeatedly mull over, Sora carefully pondered about this.
Slowly rereading out the sentence once more. He tried to confirm if what
he thinks contradicts with the sentence.
Following that, he softly whispered.
"—It clearly did not state that it was only 『One person』 right?"
""""!!!!!""""
—Just like that.
The [Nightmarish three days] will forever be passed down, and the bards
who had been singing during the duration of the fight had finally come to a
stop.
However, because the song was too long.
It wasn't kept and had to be discarded....

Part 2
……—

".........Uhhh, is it really fine if you are dressed like this?"
"It's okay. Since ancient times, Kings that wore luxurious and gorgeous
clothings are often seen as concealing their inner superficiality, or for just
self-gratification to be seen as a corpulent person. A King is not just a
national role model, but also a goal for the citizens to achieve— so in order
to gain love and respect from the people, you'll have to fight for it yourself."
"............Such sophism.........."
"Un, but ultimately, because I'm wearing this outfit, it calms me down alot."
"Ah..........anyways, I understand. But regarding the publication for the
news, this kind of details will be carefully spruced up."
Capital of Elchea— In front of the King city's public square.
It was a spectacular view after emerging out of the castle's balcony, with a
public square broader than the Piazza San Marco in Venice.
Currently, the square was being buried by a countless number of people.
Tens of thousands— tens of thousands of humans were gathered here.
But the more terrifying thing was, even the road that extended out of the
public square was filled with people.
Just to listen to a speech from their new king.
Some expressed out the disappointment towards the foolish king of the
previous generation.
Some expressed out happiness as an array of hope for the escape from
the abyss of despair had appeared.
Some expressed out curiosity for the siblings who faced against Elven
spies and defeated magic.
With the whole of Imanity's attention focusing on the balcony of the
castle—
Two figures came out from the castle.
A boy and a girl.
Wearing jeans and a T-shirt with [I ♥ humans] written on it.

With dark circles underneath his eyes, a black-haired youth.
Having white glossing hair with snow colored skin.
With a pair of jewel-like ruby eyes, a girl wearing sailor uniform.
The crown on their heads clearly highlights that they were respectively the
king and queen.
—Just only.
The youth had bended the tiara that was supposedly on the girl's head,
and was wearing it on his arm like an armband.
While the girl was wearing the crown meant for the youth on her bundled
front hair—
The actions that they both did when changing could make anyone easily
figure out what kind of screams Steph might have issued out.
As for their overly casual kind of get-up.
In front of the momentarily stunned audience, the youth— which was Sora,
began speaking.
"Ah—.....,un, un~ ugh, good morning everyone."
".........Nii, is being nervous. How rare."
"—Stop that. You know very well that we both have agoraphobia[25]. But
it's weird, usually I would be able to control it."
Shiro avoided the gaze from the crowd, and gently held onto the hand of
her brother.
"......."
She was silent, as if implying, "Then control it now".
It has always been the same from the past till now— even if its in the
future, it will still be the same.
"—Dearest citizens— no, every [Fellow human being] here!"
As if in reply to Shiro's silence, Sora dispelled his tense expression and
loudly exclaimed.

With his hands resting on the balcony that had voice amplifiers installed.
But the people could not help but think that there was no need for the voice
amplifiers due to his stern and loud voice that echoed everywhere.
"Our human kind..........being constrained by the 『Ten oaths』, forcing us
to be have continuous failures due to the predicament of not having war,
and what remains now is this last city, this last country— and why is this
happening?"
Hearing this question that was abruptly asked, the crowd went into
uncertainty.
—Because of the missteps from the previous king— because we are
unable to use magic.
All their hearts contained different answers, as they wait for Sora's next
words.
"Was it because the previous king failed? Or was it because we are ranked
16th? Or was it because we are unable to wield magic? Or was it because
we are the most inferior race? Does this equates to us feebly walking to
the path of destruction!?— sorry but, all them are wrong!"
With the strong resolution to deny it, everyone got startled.
Clenching his chest, Sora shouted with an even more resonant voice,
letting his emotions out.
"Previously, when the Old Deus started a war, deities, magical beings—the
elves, orcs and other species that were also involved, we fought valiantly,
and the result was that we survived! And in the past, all the land in this
continent was occupied by Imanity, so why?!"
Based on the history read in Steph's private stack room in this past few
days.
Sora inquired.
"Is it because our race are experts in using violence! Or is it because we
specialize in fighting!?"
One after another, the crowd started looking at each other.
"We are unlike the elves who can use a variety of magic, nor do we
possess strong physical ability like orcs, and we don't have longevity like

the Heavenly Winged— but even so, did we who dominate these lands
have any special abilities meant for war— definitely not!!"
Yes, this is the fact that everyone understands. But it is also questionable
at the same time.
—Then, why?
"The reason why we were able to fight and survive, was because we were
[Weak]!"
"No matter the era or the world, the strong will always grind their teeth
while the weak experience wisdom! So why would we reach to such an
impasse— because from the agreement of the 『Ten Oaths』, the strong
no longer grind their teeth but experience the wisdom! No other reasons!"
"Our strength to survive comes from our patent schemes, strategies,
tactics, which are meant for the weak! But now it lies in the hands of the
strong! Our weapons forcefully taken away, and to fight against the strong
with the same weapons— caused this horrifying thing to happen!"
Being pointed out this situation that made people despair, the public
square went into silence.
The people struck by the answer felt despair, and were shrouded in
instability.
Surveying the crowd while sighing, Sora said.
"—Everyone, please don't lower your heads."
In contrast to his high vigor speech and the passionate waving of his fists
from before, Sora suddenly spoke with a calm voice.
"I'll repeat it one more time, we are weak. Yes, both today—or in the
past—"
Sora reverted back to his loud voice and shouted.
"—Yes.......It has never changed up till now!"
"If the strong imitate the weak by brandishing our weapons, they won't be
able to exert their abilities! If you want to ask why, its simply because the
weaklings' weapons— were developed from their weakness when we had
reached a servile state!"

.........Sora added an answer just when everyone was feeling conflicted.
"Because of our weakness, we trained our eyes, ears and thinking,
『Learning』 how to survive, that's our trait as humans!"
.......After falling into hell for years, hope finally could be seen.
"The human species can't use magic, even perceiving it is impossible—
but because we are weak, we have the wisdom to run away from magic,
and also the intelligence to see through it! We don't have any extraordinary
senses. Simply because of being weak, from 『Learning』 and
『Experience』, we gained the wisdom to achieve the unachievable,
predicting the future!"
.......Only an optimist will sing optimistically.
.......Only a pessimist would speak about despair.
"I will reiterate for the third time! We are weak, and in no matter which
world, we will always savagely bite those complacent people who think that
they are the strong— until the 『Weak』 gain glory!"
........Because they were stuck in the depths of despair, there was not a ray
of light in the everlasting darkness.
"My little sister and I will declare, that we are the 255th generation, the king
and queen of Elchea."
..........Only the people who ignite the fire of hope can guide the public.
"Once again, I declare, the two of us will survive with the method of the
weak, fight with the method of the weak, slaughter the strong with the
method of the weak! Just like the past— it will still be the same even in the
present and the future!"
..........So that no one would leave their footprints as a guide.
"Admit it! We, are the weakest race!"
"History will repeat itself no matter what happens—we will be the ones to
bite the strong and nobody else!"
........Just like that.

"Rejoice! We are humans— we are the most talented people! Precisely
because we were born without any ability— we can achieve anything—
this is the will of the weakest race!"
.........a 『King』 was born.
Cheers— no, roars.
The public square, and even the skies started trembling.
An array of cries that sounded like both an angry roar and victory cheers.
And what were they expecting from the two people on the balcony?
Or perhaps— were they being cornered and were simply baring their fangs
and crying out?
In front of this scene, Sora and Shiro exchanged glances.
.........Nodding their heads.
Confirming that his little sister was smiling with glee after that nod, Sora
began his final moments of the speech.
Spreading open his arms, looking as pure as a curious child that was
facing against the boundless world.
But also exuding out the aura of a battle-hardened warrior with his usual
arrogance.
Sora—『Humanity's new hope』, said with an arrogant smile and a face
filled with naivety.
"—Come, let us begin the games!"
"Everyone must have had enough of the sufferings right. Starting to
behave servilely already right. Getting tired of tasting bitterness
right.....................it's enough already right? I've kept you waiting, fellow
human beings."
Looking like he has the skies within his grasp, Sora pointed his hand to the
horizon.
Then— tightly clenched his fist.
"From this instant! We, Elchea— will issue a proclamation, declaring war
on countries all around the world!"

"The smoke has finally cleared! Our borders, better be honest and come
back to us!"

Part 3
Surrounded by the huge roars that could shake the heavens.
Leaving the balcony and heading towards the exit, Steph stopped them.
"Yo-yo—you! Wh-what did you just say— !?"
"Whoa~ why are you looking so flustered, you scared me."
"...........Steph, evil......"
Facing the frantic Steph who was screaming out in a rage, the siblings
could not help but wince under her unreasonable words.
But Steph did not give in.
"How can I be calm like this!? You have just finished the coronation
ceremony, and the municipal hasn't even finish handling Elchea as of now,
how are we going to have time to prepare for war against other countries!
Are you trying to destroy this place!?"
Hugging her head, Steph kept cursing that her idiocy actually made her
believe the words of the siblings.
But, maybe she was slowly getting used to it.
In order to get a glimpse of her adept movements, Sora sighed while
saying.
"Ah..........I did say—that you should learn how to suspect people right?"
"—Hm?"
Steph suddenly stopped her movements, before gazing at Sora.
"Those elves— you still remember Avant Heim right? They used Kurami,
provided support for her to win this country, defeating humans without
positive means just because we can't use magic right?"
"—Wh-what does that mean?"
"Have you forgotten? We have already made them think that we are
『Humans that need to be supported by other countries』 oh. Or at least
this is what the guy who was supporting Kurami is likely to report, and
other countries might be thinking of the same thing too."

In accordance to his brother's words, Shiro supplemented the sentence.
"..........Whole world, will think..........that some country's spy, is
administrating Elchea."
Nodding his head in affirmation, Sora continued.
"But, they don't know which country is doing it. Don't know which country is
controlling the spy, don't know which country used Elchea as a puppet to
declare war to the world, they will definitely think of it like this—『Elchea is
being used as a puppet to launch an intention to be on the offensive』."
"—Ah!"
In this world, the challenged party has the right to decide the contents of
the game.
Which is to say, in total disregard of the extremely unfavorable conditions,
Elchea has taken the initiative to declare war on the world.
Moreover, taking into consideration that the spy sent from Elven Gard was
found out—
"A certain country or race has obtained a trump card to see through the elf
race, so they will certainly be more vigilant right?"
"......So to say."
"The world will plunge into darkness where everyone is being suspected."
".........Just for this reason, deliberately made a declaration of war."
"But not being able to do a thing, is how it is♪"
Facing against the siblings who smiled and uttered those words, Steph
was rendered speechless.
"Article 5 of the 『Ten Oaths』, the challenged party has the right to
decide the contents of the game. Those countries would start to get wary
of us due to that declaration......and also start mobilizing against the
non-existent country that is backing us. Taking advantage of the countries
that are trying to probe for our ins and outs, we will use this chance to find
loopholes, slowly and continuously secure back out territories."
Looking at Sora who was smiling wickedly while turning his body, Steph
asked.

"Th-then............all those things about recapturing territories...........are just
lies?"
Feeling slightly regretful for this matter that even surprised Steph herself.
But what Sora said was.
"—Hey, Steph. I had a discussion with my little sister— about whether we
want to return back to our original world."
"—Eh?"
"We realized that this was a no-brainer question. The answer will definitely
be 『NO』— if we abandoned this world, what would we get when we
return back? Absolutely nothing."
"........Especially.........towards Shiro."
"That's how it is. So."
Slapping his hands together, Sora concluded.
"We are humans. And we are left with our sole country which is Elchea.
So, in order to prevent losing this place, becoming the king would be the
first target— but?"
Little sister and older brother. Looking at each other, they laughed
pleasantly.
"Hey, little sister."
".....Un."
"The enemy can use magic, can use super powers, but we can't. We have
an overwhelming disadvantage, and also an underwhelming handicap,
furthermore, we are left with one more territory, the situation currently
could be said to be desperate. But, in the name of 『 』, we will not allow
any failures— what do you think?"
Shiro, with her face devoid of any expression except for a little boyish
smile, replied.
".....The best—"
"That's right~♪"

Steph looked at the genuine otherworldly— siblings that were clearly
incomprehensible.
Specifically, this was indeed a very desperate situation, yet the words that
were blurted out were actually 『The best』?
Sora turned back to face Steph who was undoubtedly puzzled.
"Then, going back to the question just now, Steph."
"—Ye-yes?"
Suddenly being accosted while in a daze, Steph could not help but change
the tone of her voice.
"About recapturing the border. Frankly, that's a lie."
"—Eh?"
Sora spoke while taking out his phone.
Opening his scheldule manager, he marked a tick under 『Becoming
King』.
Entering into a new target. Which was—
"『Final goal』— in short, conquering this world☆"
"—What—!?"
Recapturing borders— skipping over this— the words Sora said suddenly
jumped to world domination.
After hearing his gargantuan goal, Steph leaked out her voice.
How long must she continue being shocked before he becomes satisfied.
Sora then started walking away, with Shiro closely behind.
Realizing that she was getting deserted, Steph immediately snapped back
into reality and paced up to them.
"Eh, th-that, is it re-re-really the truth!?"
"For 『空白』[26], anything other than first is unacceptable. No matter if it's
gambling for the country or what, as long as it is related to games, our
motives will always to be 『the strongest』— this is our principle."

".........Un."
—Just when the development of things have reached this step.
Stephanie Dora realized that she was underestimating the siblings the
whole time.
Maybe.
Probably.
Really.
These two people—
—Are Imanity's 『Savior』?
Watching Sora whose figure was constantly receding away, a fierce
reaction came from her chest.
Her chest was being gripped tightly— except, the sense of disgust was
already long gone.
Restoring her grandfather's reputation.
Confronting and beating magic.
Saving her beloved country— Elchea.
Even going as far as to make a declaration to recapture territory.
Against the fading figure that made her believe that he could do it.
Any reasons to hate him.
For Stephanie Dora, she still hadn't found one yet.

Part 4
—Kingdom of Elchea, capital of Elchea, central region district 1.......
Which is, Elchea King City, the King's bedroom.
There was an extremely colossal bed that would make anyone wonder
how many people could fit into it placed in the center of the room.

Just a few days ago, he was still a NEET and useless— Sora(18-year-old
virgin).
"—From a cramped room, to a shabby Inn, before going to Steph's
mansion, and now, the King's bedroom— is that so."
Sora was holding onto a book while reminiscing about the past.
Basking in the darkness of the night, the name of the book that was dimly
lit by the moonlight was titled— 《The Ecology of the Sixteen Races》.
Staying on a particular page on the book, Sora was immersed in a deep
thought.
"—The Heavenly Winged(The Flügel).......eh. I feel that those guys really
be pulled into the same front ah........"
What was written on the book— The Heavenly Winged(The Flügel)In the
last war, they were created to be the vanguard for the gods, a race
capable of fighting in the air.
After the 『Ten Oaths』 were forged, their ability to fight was sealed up,
however, utilizing their longevity and the fact that they had a high degree of
adaptability for magic, with the floating species Phantasma— 『Avend
Haze』 backing them up, they created a genuine sky city, using that as
their sole territory, and never competed in any gambling for the country.
But, perhaps it was due to their longevity, that they have a strong thirst for
knowledge, so in order to collect 『Intel』 from every other race— they
participated the games to try and obtain other country's books.
"I feel that I can grasp a lot about knowledge regarding magic, furthermore,
I can use my 『Exclusive knowledge from another world』 as a bait."
If any contact was to be made with this race, the necessary preparations of
forming strategies to counter magic was definitely needed—
—Tok, Tok.
When he was thinking about these problems, a polite knock came from the
door.
Feeling like it was a déjà vu situation from a few days ago, Sora replied.
"I'm in, who is it?"

"It's Stephanie Dora.......can I come in?"
"—Ah? Please do."
Facing Steph who was slowly opening the King's set of heavy doors
leading to the bedroom, Sora said.
"I say, what is with that tone and attitude. It will be fine even if you casually
come in right."
"No.........that, if I think about it calmly, Sora— your majesty is now the king
of Elchea—"
"Argh— how uncomfortable!"
Sora loudly cut off Steph's words.
"Too uncomfortable, and also troublesome! It will be fine if it was like
always, okay, so what happened?"
In Elchea where electricity has yet to be discovered.
The things that were illuminating the bedroom were only the dimly-lit
candles on the chandelier, and also the faint moonlight.
"That— Sora......"
"Hmm?"
"In order to make me dedicate to you, you asked me to have a 『Crush on
you』 at that time, right."
"Eh— ah~....."
"Since Sora is currently the king of Elchea— I'm already, that........"
At that moment, the clouds suddenly dispersed and the moon brightened
up. What was further revealed was Steph's face.
—The expression on her face was, anxiousness.
"You.....are going to say that you don't think you have any more use, so
you want to request me to lift the【 Oath】, right?"
"N-not-not that meaning."

—Even if he possessed a super-class level in games, in the end, he was
still an eighteen year old virgin.
For him to make a judgment completely miles away, Steph quickly made
amendments.
"I-I hope— you could..........tell me. Wh-why, that, your request, wasn't like
what your sister had said—『Become my property』, but have a 『Crush
on me』......"
"......That....."
That was surely an attempt.
It could be described as a vulgar desire from deep within Sora's heart, but
it was also a mistake at the same time.
When Sora was thinking about whether he should honestly say these
reasons out.
An unexpected question suddenly surfaced in himself.
"That— asking me to fall in love with you.........that, for me, you had those
feelings, right?"
.......Eh?
"I-If that was really the truth...........then, the only thing I— can sacrifice,
is......"
Then, she slowly walk towards the bed, carrying an uneasy expression
flushed with with embarrassment.
Her skirt— she slowly raised it up, before saying something as if it
pleading.
"I'm only left with this, nothing more—"
—Wait a moment.
—Wait a moment, eighteen-year-old virgin Sora.
Now, you have just faced an unmistakably inescapable question.
It was like that...........from an objective point of view, Steph was indeed
considered as a high-standard beauty.

If liked by such a beautiful girl, naturally all the boys will harbor these kind
of thoughts.
However— forcing her to have a crush on him, why is that so?
—Love at first sight?
No, this is not accurate enough.
Although he tried to ask himself, that if he told Steph it was because he
had feelings of love—
No— in the end.
(Eh—? Feelings of love, what kind of feeling is it in the first place?)
—At this time, Sora had reached the limit of what you would call an
unpopular man.
".....That...........is, this......"
'Kacha!'
A sound, followed with a flash.
Quietly sticking her head out from the opposite side of the bed— was Shiro
who was wielding onto a cellphone.
"Yahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Realizing that Shiro was in the same room, Steph panicked and
immediately put down her skirt.
—But, it was natural that she should have noticed this matter.
As long as she thought of the things back in the Inn— she would know that
Sora could never be alone.
"........Represent, Nii who is troubled...........by his virginity..........Shiro will
explain."
"Shiro-san........to be told off like this when you are just an eleven-year-old
little sister, you surely are giving your brother a hard blow."
But ignoring the protesting sentence from her older brother, Shiro showed
the picture that she had taken just now.

Which was the self-upskirting shot that Steph did.
"....This."
"—Eh?"
".....The reason why Nii, made Steph, to fall in love."
Facing Steph who did not understand— as well as Sora.
As if wanting to make both of them understand in one fell swoop, Shiro
succinctly described.
"........Nii, misses something, from........our......original world."
"........This world, inside— doesn't have......『Dessert』."
""————Huh?""
Both Steph and Sora simultaneously shouted out in surprise.
But only, they interpreted it differently.
Sora straightforwardly protested against this accusation.
And Steph—
"Dessert......? What, does it refers to?"
Innocently gave a simple question. Playing with her phone, Shiro
answered.
".......Masturbation, time.........imagine things.........with photos and
videos.........all are included. During masturbation, usage of all those
stuffs..............are known as—『Dessert』....."
"...Mastur........bate?"
With Steph still clueless about what was going on, Shiro with her deadpan,
Firmly held onto— and began moving it up and down.
"———Wh———"
Hearing a 'bang' sound in her mind, Steph's face flushed red, before she
approached Shiro.
Opening the file in her phone, Shiro showed it to Steph.

—What was playing on the phone, was the scene where both Shiro and
Steph were in the bath, with Steph washing Shiro's hair.
"........This is.............the Steph...........『raison d'etre』."
Steph's face turned pale first, before she lowered her head and deeply
shook.
—Which means, anyone could be in it, right.
——Purely for sex, he requested it, right.
———Furthermore, even his sister is naked too, that, that kind of thing,
right!?
"Sha—Shameless"
Screaming loudly, Steph dashed out of the room— Sora could only watch
her leave innocently.
Thereafter, Shiro returned back to her previous position with an attitude as
if that didn't happen and asked.
"—I say, I have never thought of something that disgusting to that extent
oh?"
"..........But, to interpret......"
"That's just a super wrong interpretation right...........and just now that,
wasn't it the video inside the bath? Didn't you say that you wouldn't let me
watch that even when 『it came out』— unless, you are deliberately trying
to make Steph hate me right?"
".....Shiro, eleven-years-old...........don't know, too complicated things."
"Only at this inappropriate time then you would behave like a child......"
"........The picture just now, don't want it......?"
"Ah, sorry director. I want it."
—But.
In reality— what's the difference between love and sex?
To Sora, this was just a philosophical reflection if he were to immerse
himself into it.

In a voice where he could not hear, Shiro— the little sister who has no
blood relations with Sora, muttered.
"........Seven years, more......."
—Although there was a saying that girls are more precocious than boys in
terms of maturity.
But........at least for the situation as of now, this is the unshakable truth.
——…………
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh really, ah——this is enough ———!"
On the other hand, Steph angrily stomped through the hallway.
For her to be simply used as a material for masturbation— which is not so.
She felt that she had hurt herself after hearing that, roaring angrily.
"AHhhhhhhhhhhh really, these feelings are all an illusion, it's because of
the Oaths' fault— this is just a curse!"
—However, Steph didn't notice such things.
"That monkey! Lolicon! How can I like him! This is all the Oaths' fault!"
—Letting Sora 『Release the Oaths』—Which is to say.
Proposing another game to be held, and force him to say 『Don't have a
crush on me』.
This solution was completely ignored, or she had completely forgotten this
fact.
Or is there a significance behind it—.

Epilogue
Part 1
Audience hall, King City. Elchea.
Currently, there were two people sitting on the throne, immersed in a
DSP[27] game.
A youth with black hair, wearing a T-shirt with『I♥Humans』on it and
jeans, as well as a bent tiara on his arm.
A girl with skin and hair as white as snow, wearing a sailor uniform, and
crimson-colored eyes, as well as a Crown that was worn on her bundled
front hair.
To tell you the truth— they are the king of this kingdom—Sora, and the
Queen— Shiro.
"So ah, if you are going to play in that method, make sure you don't fall into
the traps."
"...........Prioritised, efficiency."
"If you want to pursue efficiency, doesn't using that method serves no
purpose at all, just go all out, go all out!"
"...........Simply, a waste of time, not, interesting at all."
"I guess that's about it for this one then............. shall we play some other
games?"
Even though the two of them brought a huge amount of games to this
world.
They had already played all of it.
Which is to say, its really doubtful if they can pass the time playing those
games.
But there was a justified reason why the siblings were bored. That's
because—
"I-I'm done with changing......"

Hearing that voice, both of them sent their DSP into sleep mode without a
slight hesitation, and took out their phones.
Accompanying the voice, was the appearance of a red-haired girl with the
qualities of a beauty— but only.
What she was wearing was over the top— yet not too much under this
circumstances, a extremely revealing maid outfit.
Stephanie Dora............lineage of the previous King, former a member of
royalty— and now.
Looking at Steph who was flushed, Sora said.
"Hmm? So this degree of exposure will make you blush eh?"
".........Underwear, did not let her, wear."
"Co-could you please not specifically say it out!?"
Steph shouted out.
—Yes. Both kings were currently fumbling over the boundaries of 18 and
above.
Simply hearing『That way, Nii, will be happy』, Steph knew that she would
be unable to defy Shiro's words.
Similar to the effort of love— no, it should be more correct to say that she
had already become a toy for them to play with.
She could not help but masochistically look up the ceiling.
"Ah, she really looks like a 2D character."

"....Un.....but, still not enough."
"Yes, director. After all ,she isn't as quiet as the real 2D characters,
definitely won't give one the utmost satisfaction."
".......Let her, strip?"
"Hmm— Steph. Can you undo your outfit to the extent that we can't see
your nipples and private parts?"
"Please don't say private parts ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
".......Then, a flash."
"NO. Because she is not wearing any, It'll instantly be a no go, director."
".......Nevermind.......just think that, to cover up— just stick the band-aid."
"Hmm............Hmm......no, wait.......eh? But I think it'll still be counted a no
go oh?"
"..........Then, is a small sized, swimsuit..........also a no go?"
"—In-indeed. But director, can't sticking band-aid on the naked body
works."
"......Gu........all ages, difficult."
——Leaning on the throne, Sora quietly muttered.
"But I think ah, no matter how much we let her wear a costume that is a
barely OK for filming, if the fact stands that there will be no chances for me
to fap, then isn't it useless to pile the video number up......"
Shiro who keenly heard those words, replied.
"........Shiro..........doesn't mind, feel free."
"Your brother, doesn't have exhibitionism okay?"
"......Shiro, won't see.......it's okay........at home, is also the same."
"Un? No, wait wait wait, but I only do it when you are asleep."
".........Little movements......Shiro will wake up."
"You— were awake the whole time!?"

Sora covered his reddened and shamed face with both his hands.
"No way— I can't get married anymore—!"
".......Shiro will marry you, no problem."
Shiro gently patted him on the shoulder as encouragement.
"I say—!"
"If you say that you can't get married anymore, what should I, who was
requested to wear such costumes, do!"
Steph whose shoulders were trembling shouted out, before she intolerably
continued her words.
"Its better to say, how could you throw the whole work of the coronation
formalities to me alone, and then suddenly called me out for this thing after
three continuous nights of working! Are you really noble!"
"..........Shiro, is king........king.....noble."
Shiro gave out a decent advice, while Sora nonchalantly continued.
"All nighters for three days, we are also the same oh. Even if we continued
for another two days, it will be easy."
"Isn't your case only applied to games!?"
"Yeap, game. In this world, a king's job."
"Guu......"
Yes— games to decide everything— even borders were also decided
using this method.
It was necessary to be the best of the best in games to be a king, but it
could also be an exercise.
"Oh yeah, if playing games here is considered a good work, this really is
paradise eh.
Facing Sora who looked like he had found an ideal home, Steph cried out.
"This is totally not a good job! You better settle the internal affairs first!'

"Then........is the coronation job finished yet?"
"Yes, just now, before I was summoned here."
"That was really long. After all the civilization games I played, it will be a
piece of cake to deal with the internal affairs."
Concluding his sentence, Sora pushed aside Shiro and stood up from the
throne.
"Then— could you gather all the ministers here?"

Part 2
When all the ministers were gathered at the parliament building.
Sora and Shiro went onto the stage—
But they interrupted all the reports and began speaking first.
"I have something to say."
With everyone's attention directed to his face, Sora— humanity's king
started giving out orders.
"Everyone should know by now, that <Imanity> is currently in an impasse.
We can be on the offensive, but we can't guard against attacks from the
inside. So to cut off all worries here— we will proceed with Jan-Ken.
He spread open his hands and raised it above his head.
Facing the ministers that were entirely focused on him, Sora bellowed.
"With [From now on, all false reports are strictly prohibited, as well as the
act of arbitrary to convey information lies] as a bet.........【Swearing upon
the Ten Oaths】, any duels with me will result in a loss."
The [Absolute compliance] rules in the Oaths, winning a game without
lifting a finger could be used.
—An expression that clearly depicted curiosity on why this wasn't thought
out by the previous kings, Sora said.
"Then everyone, with the responsibility on humanity's fate resting on our
shoulders, let's have a game of Jan-Ken— I will use scissors, everyone

else please use paper, to prove your loyalty to me. Additionally, those that
underestimate the observation and memory skills of us siblings, you don't
have to take part in this false match and refuse this contract, but I'd advice
you to use this opportunity to leave."
—To those who decided from the start to lose and be in compliance with
the Oaths, Sora raised his hand—
"【Acciente】"
"""—【Acciente】!"""
Using this conditions, Jan-ken began.
Just like that— conditions were exchanged between both parties.
".........Then, firstly, the agriculture minister— report."
"Yes— our country's food supplies are currently facing a profounding
question."
Continuing onwards, the agriculture's morphology, management method,
the distribution of taxes and etcetra.
Listening to all this, Sora gently nodded his head.
"I understand........then please fulfill what I am going to tell you next."
"......Yes."
"Regarding agriculture— I will introduce a rotation for the agriculture."
"—Yes, what it means?"
"In every ranch, starting with winter wheat→ turnips, beets and root related
crops→ Summer barley and rye→ Alfalfa and other pasture that can restore
fertility. In sequence, farm them in a cycle."
Smoothly, as if it was natural for him.
Faced an opinion that would clearly made anyone doubt their own ears,
everyone could only be astonished.
Furthermore—

"With regards to that, disperse the workforce and make them concentrate
on a specific area, the most important two points. Although this would lead
some small farmers to be unemployed, the amount of food production
would increased by four times or more. So put this in the highest priority."
Even the ensuing results had been pointed out.
"Bu-budget, how to do it?"
"Command the bank to use the national debt to purchase in big bulks—
however, this matter should be left for the economy minister."
"— O-obeyed."
"Following that, there will be a need to deal with the problem of
unemployment resulting from this policy. Economy minster, and Industry
minister, please report—"
—….....
After that, the King gave out orders one after another, totally reforming the
system.
In a span of four hours, the meeting finally ended.
The ministers would discuss that Sora was probably『Humanity's greatest
king』in private.
........Swinging his Tablet PC with one hand, Sora said.
"Ahhhhh— I feel like an idiot, but it was the right choice to download that
e-book about games which was loaded with all those specialized books."
Inside the Tablet PC— contained more than forty thousand books.
Besides mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, physics and engineering,
there were also medicine, history and even tactical books.
Even information given only to teachers were all extracted and saved—
which is to say, all the knowledge human beings possess in the twenty-first
century were mounted inside.
"..........Nii, sure enough, as titled..............that is, cheating."

Pointed out by Shiro with squinted eyes, Sora frowned before replying.
"In this world where magic exists and is an official method to cheat, does
passing on some technical skills from another world really counts as
cheating? And also, stability and internal affairs are always a priority."
.......Even so, introducing advanced technical skills of the future might lead
to an unexpected outside influence.
Honestly, although the thought of introducing [Electrical engineering] was
very tempting.
"At least we will be able to make a camera and microphone, which would
slightly be able to confront magic."
There was no certain what could the two cell phone which was unable to
receive signal do.
Sure enough, the method to communicate with the The Heavenly
Winged(The Flügel) still needed to be found—
—Suddenly, still dressed in the maid outfit which was full of exposure,
Steph quietly walked into the meeting room.
That was— the outfit that Shiro and Sora requested for her to wear.
"......Sora— No. You-your majesty......you have a guest."
"—You, actually tended to a guest in that outfit? How brave."
"........Steph, powerful."
"You should've just said it clearly that I could change! Guahhhh!"
Because of Steph's cries, Sora waved his hands while plugging his ears.
"Ah— okay okay, sorry, you should go and change now. Really, this will
definitely question the morality of this country."
"What really needs to be questioned is the things stored in your brain!"
However, not waiting for Steph to take charge, a big sound echoed in the
meeting room.
"Ahahahahahahaha, looks like something interesting is brewing."

Sora and Shiro, Steph, as well as the ministers turned to face the voice.
'Kata, kata'— walking in, was a teenager.
That familiar face, had previously left an impression on Sora and Shiro.
It was definitely him.
During that time— when hands stretched through the computer screen—
pulling both of them into this world—
"........Yo, isn't this that self-proclaimed Kami-sama[28]. How's it going?"
"How cruel. That is not a self proclamation, but a true and genuine
Kami-sama."
Scratching his head with a smile, the teenager said.
"Speaking of which, I haven't introduce myself yet right—"
"—『TET』........at your service. Pleased to meet you, 『

』-san."

All of a sudden—
When the name of that teenager was spoken, the whole atmosphere
undergo a change.
Or perhaps this was the influence power that the name of Kami possessed.
Aside from Sora and Shiro, everyone else felt goosebumps and a huge
amount of sweat flowed out.
The ministers were paled-face, and Steph was trembling as if she was
going to collapse any second.
But, to them, they didn't mind it nor get affected by it at all.
"So how is it, my world. Satisfied with it?"
"Ah, of course, you really have good taste. A doctrine that our world should
follow to."
"....Yeap."
For Sora and Shiro who were joking around.

Everyone was experiencing a feeling similar to their heart being clenched.
—What stood in front of them was the sole Kami—『TET』.
An authoritative figure who could destroy and re-create world as he liked.
But, the Kami-sama that they knew was putting on a smile and laughing.
"That would certainly be better than before. Okay.......it appears that
Humanity's crisis has been resolved eh."
"That's right, just like you had hoped."
A surprised expression was on everyone's faces.
"Coincidentally in the city near your home, coincidentally in Humanity's last
country, coincidentally hosting the King's election game.........this kind of
things, I hope you won't say something like [It's just pure coincidence]
right."
Facing the bold words coming from Sora, Kami laughed comfortably.
"Ahahah........But please do not misunderstand. I am basically a spectator,
never helping a particular race— but then, only this once, I let my personal
feelings went wild."
The teenager— or Kami, looking somewhat disgruntled, kicked the floor in
boredom, before saying.
"Remember what I said........that phrase— [A world where everything is
decided by games]."
—As if realising something, Sora learned the meaning behind this words
and replied."
".......I see. Even the throne of Kami, is also decided by games right?"
"——Wha——"
—Aside from an admirable look from Shiro, everyone else was
dumbfounded.
After that the sole Kami— TET, let out a pleasant smile and said.

"Correct♪ For this motive, I deliberately stated that there were the 【16
races】(Exceed)."
In an instant— the puzzles inside Sora's mind pieced together.
16 races— on the other side of the horizontal chessboard— Kami was said
to live there.
Each side of the chess that has chess pieces— numbered 16. Which
means.
"........Subduing every single race, would entitle a right— a right
to『Challenge Kami』right?"
Happily smiling, TET replied.
"Your thinking speed really is worthy of being praised. An adaptability that
someone from a different world cannot possibly have."
"That really is a generous compliment♪"
"It is just as you said. It's rare for me to deliberately bet up『The throne of
Kami』for an outcome, but I've already spent a few thousand years of
boredom till it could no longer be boring anymore. So, while wandering in a
different world, I heard the rumours of 『 』."
Feeling both elated and excited, Kami said so while looking at the siblings.
"A legend of being the top in every game, the urban legend about this
gamers."
Against Kami who was smiling while exclaiming out, Sora arrogantly said
with an unyielding expression.
"I say Kami-sama, can I laugh?"
"Hmm?"
"After knowing about our situation, you summoned us into this world.
Doesn't that imply that— you were familiar with the principle behind
『 』— about us being [the top in every game]?"
"Un, of course."
Still holding onto that fearless smile, Kami replied.

"Because of this. I believe— that you will definitely earn the right to
challenge me."
Everyone who heard that were stunned into position.
This words— means that it went beyond the world's largest country— the
elves that were ranked 7th.
Or maybe it even pointed swords at the ranked one and ranked two,
<OldDeus> and <Fantasma> respectively.
Which is— the meaning of dominating all of 【16 races】(Exceed)This
wasn't something that was going to stop even after the whole world was
conquered—
"........Hey, Kami-sama, can I ask again. If I could laugh?"
"You, haven't forgotten that you lost to us once right?"
—This time, everyone could not help but wonder if they heard wrongly.
——Kami, lost?
———lost to someone standing here, a simple human?
However, TET only smiled gently.
"Hehe, although you should've understood by now, I will still emphasise it,
the [Games] here are different from your world's internet chess oh?
Indeed, I did lose to you siblings in『Ordinary chess』— and because of
that, I summoned you both here. But.........I won't lose the next time oh?"
At this time, Sora and Shiro, understood something.
Exchanging glances with each other, smiled.
"—Kami-sama."
However, Kami-sama— kindly responded to them.
"It's alright if you call me TET. Is there anything wrong?"
"About that, TET— you, haven't lost before right?"

Just this words.
The fearless smile on TET face changed.
"Playing as a Kami— this is his first defeat. He would then feel an
incomparable remorse, remorseful until it became unbearable. That's why
you summoned us here— to win under the [Rules of this side]. Am I right?"
"Hehe.......interesting. Why would you think so?"
With his smile still unshaken, TET asked.
"Because that feeling, we ourselves understand it as well. 『 』has
never failed before— however, we experienced numerous failures when
facing against each other."
".......But, definitely no allow, running after winning."
"In the end, my genius little sister and I know that feeling."
".......Nii, full of sneaky measures........more and more, terrible."
"Oi, don't you say that I'm full of sneaky measures. Tricks are also a part of
the game now."
".....Cheater, how despicable."
"It's not a problem if no one found out! Isn't this side of the world the same
as well !?"
Gazing at the siblings' battle.
And feeling calmness in his heart, TET laughed so loud that everyone
aside from the siblings shrunk.
"Ahahahahaha. Un, it was indeed the right choice to summon you here.
Yeap, definitely no running after winning. Next time will be my win— it was
also one of the reasons why I called you here oh. Disappointed?"
"Why? Rather than say out a more noble reason like saving Humanity, you
make us feel more at ease eh. So, did Kami-sama leisurely come here just
to deliberately say those words?"
"Nope, I came to express my gratitude."

"You both— Although <Imanity> was just a side-effect, you still defeated
Elven Gard, and let the world fall into suspicion in accordance with your
plan. The Eastern United Front are extremely concerned with the [Phone]
that you displayed out, thinking so hard about which country could have
developed that until they couldn't sleep. What are your thoughts? Similarly,
Avand Haze is also deeply interested and curious about the technology
that defeated Elven Gard. And as for Elven Gard, they are buzzing with
activity thinking about where the technology that defeated them came from.
If they found out that they were not defeated by cheat but rather
face-to-face— haha, they will definitely catch you and examine you
closely."
For TET who kindly provided some intelligence, Sora asked in a somewhat
surprised tone.
"Didn't you say, that you won't help any particular race?"
"Un, so take this as a thank-you gift. Bringing back enthusiasm for such a
boring world, I provided you such information for thanks. Because this is
the first time, this will also be the last, so please utilize this meaningfully
oh."
"Then, If I continue to stay here, everyone else won't be able to calm down,
so this is where I depart. BYEBYE♪"
Concluding his sentence, TET smiled and turned around, walking out.
Hearing this words from Kami who was about to leave, Sora and Shiro
shouted out.
"Oi, TET!"
"Hmm?"
"Thank you for giving us new life. Indeed— this is world where we should
belong."
".....Thank you, Kami-sama."
Then, the three of them said in unison.
"""........In the upcoming future— let us meet on the board."""

—Just like that, TET disappeared as if dissolving into the air.
This act allowed everyone else to breath again, feeling completely relieved
that it ended.
—I wonder if this legend was heard?
"Fuu.....what an interesting Kami eh."
"......wanted, to play game.....with him."
—In all games, a champion player had set unbroken records.
—Suddenly, that mysterious gamer disappeared, losing all contact.
—For the [Urban Legend]— it eventually became a [Myth].
"Th-th-that gentleman— was the so-so-so-sole Kami-sama !?"
"Ki-King! Di-did you really win against Kami!"
"No, compared to that, the Eastern United Front has already started to take
action on us, in our current state we will—"
"Before that, Elven Gard has already began on us! If they have their eyes
on our King and Queen—"
—Then, the story about the disappearance that soon became a myth....
—Will shift to a new stage known as [Disboard], the story will continue
writing even after it had finished.
"Ahh—how annoying! Don't talk at the same time!"
".....Nii."
"Ah, I got it—"
Facing all the people that were juxtaposed.
Sora stood on stage with an aloof expression.
Placing his foot on the conference table, he said with open arms.

—Although it is a fixed phrase.
—It also has it's own beauty. So we will start with this.
—『A long long time ago——』
"Okay— let us begin the games. Target, let's just set it to defeating
Kami-sama♪"
—Then, this new myth, shall begin narrating from now.

Afterwords
Fuuu~~~~~~~This is it, this is it! I always wanted to do this— an
[Afterwords] ! Nice to meet you, because I am always the [Party
responsible for the illustrations], so I always dreamt that I would write an
afterwords with the position of a writer, and it was finally realized today— I
am the writer and illustrator called Kamiya Yuu. Erm, I am actually a
Mangaka. Ah, yes, un........currently taking a break........because I am
suffering from a troublesome illness, I will temporarily stop the work of my
Manga due to the great burden. And also, credits to [Itsuka Tenma no Kuro
Usagi](Fujimi Fantasia Bunko), comparing to a Mangaka, I feel that being
an illustrator earns more recognition......even reaching out to the light
novels, so my current job is.........no, but then, I am still drawing Mangas!
Okay, going back to topic, 《No game,No life》is my debut novel. It was
originally an idea for a manga. But in accordance to Sensei's hope, "I like
this fantasy setting, but I hate fighting!". So, for me who hates the
troublesome drawings needed for fighting manga based on my personal
experience, I fulfilled that wish! But then I thought, "Erm, why don't I just
create a fantasy world where fightin doesn't exist!". When I'm not working
nor sleeping, I devoted all my time to create a setting about [Games]!"
『Even the borders are also determined by games——Gambling for the
country!』
With this mindset and all my ideas, I tried it out. However~ unfortunately
this plan did not give form. I hope that one day, this would be accepted, so
I wrote down the plotline. At that time, because of my sudden poor physical
condition, I had to stop my Manga job. Laying on the hospital bed while
being SUPER bored and the fact that games were forbidden, it feels as if—
—God said .........that fate won't allow you to <Fade away>.
.......Gu, I hope it isn't too late. It should still be okay, I can't give up. Just
like that, when I was in the hospital, I dramatically changed the plot to
make it feel like what a novel would have. And with this style— ah, I
suddenly remembered something from Editor-san— "Because they are
some people who decide whether to buy a book based on the afterwords,
you better publicise it well." So, let's start shall we?
No Game, No life.
A pair of siblings only good with games

The two useless trash were thrown into.
A world, where war is banned and everything is decided by games.
Including life— or even the borders of the world were being bet.
Enemy— are those who can use Magic and supernatural power, the 【16
races】.
[Bet on it......your everything.]— Little sister— Shiro, 11 years old
/Shut-in/Anti-social.
[No way— it is impossible for humans to defeat magic!] — Stephanie Dora,
18 years old/Victim for majority of times/Royalty(?)
—And Mankind, cannot use magic.
Desperately stuck in a adversity, the worst situation— but
Stirring the nation!
An Anti Battle, Game Battle Fantasy！
Can you, the <Authour>, survive the impact of the well-known <Deadline>?
[For human kind to survive in this world........there is only one
method......]— Kurami???
[Don't.......underestimate humans!] — Brother— Sora, 18 years
old/Unemployed Virgin/NEET.
Author— Kamiya Yuu, Idiot/Pervert/Phobia of deadlines.
Okay— the original text should have such a feeling. (No joke)
Although there is a possibility of fraud present in this, like other Hollywood
movies.
If everyone who started reading from the afterwords, in order to confirm the
authenticity, I hope you will choose this as a read♪
For those who have read finished this novel— that, un, erm.
IF you think that this will be good enough to be sold off as a Manga, with
me as the Mangaka, then I have to ask for forgiveness—

"Kamiya-sensei Kamiya-sensei."
—Eh? Ah, yes, is there something wrong? Editor S-san.
"Do you want me to listen things regarding the Manga? After all,
Kamiya-sensei has a tangible achievements as a Mangaka—"
Ahahha, sorry, regarding that, I can't hear clearly because the phone is too
far away.
"Didn't you say that it was [Because of your poor physical condition, you
can't draw Mangas and try to write novels which have a smaller burden],
yet at the end of this novel, you could still draw some storyboard?"
Wasn't it you for ask me to draw this!
"Eh? I only suggested [Since the author and illustrator are the same
person, and is still a Mangaka, you could use this point to boost some
publicity]."
—From this statement, was there any other meaning besides [Drawing
Manga]?
"I didn't say it oh?"
Guuuu.
In my eyes, the image of lead editor and the protagonist seems to concide
together.
Stephanie's antipathy, or maybe it was stronger than that☆
Ah, right.
In the same month, Takaya Kagami's work.
《Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi》 Volume 10.[The Witch Laughing in the
Schoolyard], will be responsible by yours truly!
I am also serious in that side also oh, so be sure to read that too!
......Fuu, then, after writing till here.
It hasn't ended yet.
Better to say, currently— I am in Brazil.

Because I did mention that I had "Physical problems.", so I temporarily
return back to my homeland.
Or maybe, the text and illustrations in 《No game,No life》
The illustrations for Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi too, will be completed
here, in Brazil.
—A number of large suitcases, filled with LCD screen and a computer.
"The purpose for leaving?"
To cure my illness.
"What are all this equipment for?"
Work use.
.......In short, becaue fo the tariff disputes that arose, the situation was not
difficult to imagine.
—Yeah, it sounds really deceiving. I am just a patient.
Getting treated halfway around the world, while getting grilled by the
publishing companies. I really want to cry.
"Forgive me, Kamiya-sensei."
Ah? What happened? Lead editor S-san.
"No, I am actually an M—anyways, you have recognized the schedule for
MF Bunko J and Fujimi Bunko already right?"
I don't remember any impression of it at all!
"No, even if told off like this....."
Speaking of which, New Year's Eve of CM has already entered the final
sprint of the twelfth lunar month, of course I won't take the schedule
seriously, right!
"No, that, it should've been Kamiya-sensei without a dou—"
Lead Editor S-san started emanate killing intent.
As expected of the successor of former editor Catherine-san.......the
mirror-like moves is definitely a surprise.

Targeting someone who has dumbfounded—.......
Then.......can this do?
"———Then, what are you talking about?"
Ex. Tend. Dead. Line♥
"Guu— the signal is quite bad, I couldn't quite catch it—"
But ah, adjusting the number of pages and cutting the text to 8 page, I am
afraid that I had [Forgotten to include the 10 illustrations from Itsuka] the
moment I return back to Japan, so the situation is unprecedented.
"..........That, you can't treat it as it happened right?"
If the proofreader can remove this part, can I say it out?
"Because of me, Editor S's fault , I will give you more work, even the
remedial work will be handed to Kamiya-sama, sorry and I hope you
forgive me."
—Very good, a perfect plan for revenge against me.
Till then, I sincerely hope we meet in the next volume.
"Ah, oh right. Kamiya-sensei, when can the manuscript for volume 2 be
accomplished? Eh? Kamiya-sensei~~~~~~~Hey~~~~~~~!"
